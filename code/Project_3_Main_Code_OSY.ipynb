Because of this DreamWorks is looking to use targeting advertising to find Pixar fans and sway them to become DreamWorks fans. This project explores reddit comments in the `DreamWorks` and `Pixar` subreddits, to find language patterns to patterns to predict whether a person is a `Pixar` fan or a `DreamWorks` fan.\n",

After that, we want to get rid of any URLs that a comment might have in it. This way the URL won't count as a word when we come to `CountVercotrize` the comments. We are not getting ride of the comment itself, just the URL in the comment. The rest of the words in the comment will be preserved. Finally some post will have been removed or deleted, these posts have `[removed]` or `[deleted]` (these can be found by looking at the first 50 rows) in the body column. We will need to drop these columns since we have no information on them. Also we have to drop the `Unnamed: 0` column since we do not need it."

We also want to maximize our model's `precision` over the other metrics. This way, we may accidentally assign a comment of not being in a subreddit when it is (i.e. say that it does not belong to `Pixar` when it actually does). But this way we will not assign a comment to the wrong subreddit (i.e say that a `DreamWorks` comment is a `Pixar` comment).\n",
