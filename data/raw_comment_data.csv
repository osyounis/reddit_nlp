1,Pixar,Agreed!,1631420559
2,Pixar,"Cars was my first ever Pixar movie, I would watch it like everyday as a kid, I watched both Cars and Cars 2 like everyday when I was young, I still got the DVDs but they have so many scratches (so I got both New Blu-Rays and DVDs)",1631404031

Where did you get these?",1631403433
6,Pixar,"Both are really good, but I like the final one's quieter score because it sets the tone for the film's mysteriousness.",1631396725
7,Pixar,"I don't think it's possible for me to dislike Cars 2. I was obsessed with it as a little kid, and I loved the spy action (I agree, I thought Finn McMissile was the coolest character ever lmao) and the races around the world.

Obviously now as a teenager I can see the flaws in this movie but childhood bias keeps me coming back to it. It's overhated for sure, though.",1631395397
8,Pixar,"It may not be the best Pixar movie, and it's not my favorite, but I don't hate it. I always liked Mater, so I didn't mind more of him. And Finn McMissile was undeniably cool. He was kind of a James Bond character, and some of the score underscores that: his theme and other cues are Bond-eqsue. Much of the score, as you said, is good.",1631394669

15,Pixar,I always figured it was cheese (cheddar I think but I'm not sure) and pomegranate seeds.,1631372666
16,Pixar,I think Brad Bird maybe wanted something more subtle and mysterious. That's my best guess,1631368352
17,Pixar,"I do like this version a lot better! Wonder why they didn‚Äôt use it

It doesn‚Äôt have the short Incredibles motif that plays at the end of the Pixar logo in the original, but other than that it‚Äôs definitely better",1631368274

73,Pixar,Me too,1631186412
74,Pixar,Yeah and the reason why Bug Life so far is due to the rusty trailer which was pretty clean in Monster inc,1631183909
75,Pixar,Is that confirmed or is it just a theory,1631182520
76,Pixar,"I like this pretty well, this works a lot better than that theory trying to have everything in one timeline.

I would personally put Brave at the beginning of the normal timeline though I guess it could also be in another one though. I think Onward was their only other movie to feature Magic though but I don't think it and Brave work together on the same planet as there's no fantasy creatures in Brave and there's no humans in Onward.

Onward had two moons in it, I consider it another planet based on that so I could see it fitting into any timeline excluding the Car's one as a Mater's Tall Tales short showed off that living U.F.Os also exist in that universe. Granted it was implied Mater was making those up but I'm sure he still played off some U.F.O lore in their world.

I think Star Command was supposed to be a cartoon series that existed in the Toy Story universe and Buzz was merchandise for it like Woody was for Woody's Round Up. Granted there is that Lightyear movie in the works so that could still turn out to be some other universe, either that or it's a movie in the Toy Story universe or it's actually a real person in the Toy Story universe and then the Toy was based off them.",1631182166
77,Pixar,"I think what the creators in Monsters Inc had planned was that the Monsters were in their own universe but we're jumping into another one through the doors. For example, all the vanished monsters are ending up in the normal timeline and they are scaring kids in the normal timeline.

The monsters regularly cross over to the normal timeline but they don't live in it.",1631181561
78,Pixar,It shares the same universe as cars even if it's not Pixar.,1631181289
79,Pixar,Ok but why the hell is planes in there,1631179953
80,Pixar,Its a very good timeline but i think u should connect the Monsters Inc universe to the Bug's Life one due to the same caravan being shown in both films.,1631179425

94,Pixar,"Yeah, I remember playing this game after becoming a fan of the series after the first film and pretty much anything I could in relation (Scream Arena, Pinball Panic, Infinity, etc.).
I don't remember much about Scream Team...as a game. Probably it was bog standard Disney-published 'heres something to play about Pixars---I mean, our---latest film!' sort of thing.

But, for a loreish perspective and premise, there's interest. I like the concept that there's a special island for training Scarers in various habitats (though one considers why so harsh if they're just in a child's room, but who knows, maybe it was also emergency training as well), having 'primordial ooze' as a factor, and showing that Randall was actually a scareing veteran before Sullivan and Wazowski even got to MI (not to mention TRAINING them as well!).

It's kind of the thing for the Monsters Inc. base game too...though it has some bulking because of gameplay (how an apartment became a highwise and the Waternoose boss at the end...), but it was ok for a laugh.
Overall, such games can fall flat, but if you get it for a few bucks as a fan of the franchise, you can get some 'oh look at that' sorta moments that help enrich it a bit more that a single film may not get in.",1631111341

66,Pixar,"Tell me about it! Even the director said it was about childhood and friendships! Mica was i spired by the director‚Äôs childhood. When he was a boy, he lived in a sheltered life until he met this other boy who encouraged him to come out of his shell and they explored the coast of Italy together. The sea monsters subplot was inspired by tales of sea monsters that they heard from local fishermen. 
Anyway, the two were close friends as well. 
I had to look up on PluggedIn (a website that reviews movies from a Christian perspective) to get a confirmation that the boys in Luca are not gay and the movie is not about lgbtq.",1630904012
67,Pixar,"Brave is the one I have a problem with. When they advertised the movie, I expect it to be an epic adventure about Merida trying to save her kingdom and family from doom (similar to Raya and the Last Dragon and maybe Frozen). But then the plot was revealed and frankly, I found it very underwhelming and not so epic. I couldn‚Äôt understand what the problem was between Merida and Elinor. Why are they always arguing with each other, even before the arranged marriage came up? If Elinor wanted Merida to take her role as a princess seriously so she can become queen, shouldn‚Äôt the story end with Merida taking things seriously (doesn‚Äôt have to end with her being married). And I felt that the subplot of the mom turning into a bear ruined the dynamic between the mom and daughter, because of the language barrier. 
Also I find Merida to be way too modern for someone who is supposed to be a 14th century Scottish princess. As a princess, shouldn‚Äôt she be aware that an arranged marriage would be in the future for her? As unfair as it sounds, arranged marriages were the norm for royalty in those days. Marriages were based on who gets the property, joining lands together, and financial security. The whole concept of marrying someone for love and commitment is a 20th century idea. If Brave was an alternate fantasy world or took place in modern times, then maybe I would forgive Merida for being so modern. But her movie takes place in historical Scotland, so it doesn‚Äôt make any sense for her to act so modern or for her to react negatively toward arranged marriages the same way as a 21st century woman would. 
Also I felt that Merida didn‚Äôt bring anything new to the table compared to the other Princesses, other than her bow and arrow. I would have find her love interesting if her goal was to become a famous archer but couldn‚Äôt because she is a princess.",1630903527
68,Pixar,Yes I played it on PS3! It was a surprisingly fantastic game. I remember games made after children‚Äôs movies never being very good. However this was a fully fleshed out and satisfying game,1630903267
69,Pixar,"I agree that Toy Story 4 didn‚Äôt ruin anything. I too, thought it brought a satisfying conclusion to Woody‚Äôs arc. Back when I saw TS3, I was in agreement that all toys‚Äô story arcs were completed (Jessie found an owner who adored her and Buzz became comfortable acting like a toy, etc.). But with Woody, I was like ‚ÄúI bet he is secretly sad or something because of Bo Peep.‚Äù And TS4 proved me correct. I also think TS4 is supposed to be an extended epilogue of the third sequel.",1630902843
70,Pixar,"Oh, bummer. Maybe she would do better in Sony if Pixar is very-in house. How does Pixar get new talent if they are in-house? What happens if the founders of Pixar pass away or decide to retire?",1630902590
71,Pixar,"I remember this game, my best memories of playing on my Wii are from this game.",1630901059
72,Pixar,Which platform did you play it on? I played the ps3 version. It‚Äôs the only one that has Zurg as a playable character in the toy box.,1630900781
73,Pixar,"I didn‚Äôt play it until recently but it‚Äôs still a solid game, especially for a movie tie-in game.",1630900628
74,Pixar,This would make a wonderful fan fiction story!,1630898655
75,Pixar,"Wow, this light box is amazing! How long did it take to create?",1630898200
76,Pixar,that‚Äôs the thing about Pixar movies / games. they‚Äôre generally good and everyone has their favorite,1630897823
77,Pixar,ToY Story 2 on N64 was better,1630896545
78,Pixar,Had it on the Wii when I was 7 I think. Good game. Played it many times thru the years until I sold all my Wii stuff.,1630896431
79,Pixar,She explains it in the movie. Without missquoting it: its something about being extra tough to do this even tho men will look down on her because shes a woman.,1630895838
80,Pixar,"I REMEMBER THIS OMG I USED TO PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.

It was actually incredibly good",1630895567
81,Pixar,"Sure, the game is cool and all ‚Äî but its no Toy Story 2 Activity Center",1630892901
82,Pixar,This was one of my fav games man,1630888112
83,Pixar,"It‚Äôs a rewards program. When you see Disney, Pixar, most Marvel, Star Wars, and some 20th Century Studios films in theaters or buy them on Blu-ray/Digital/DVD, you can go to Disney Movie Insiders to get points from them which can be used for rewards, which can include merchandise, Blu-rays/DVDs, posters, and Disney gift cards.

The program is only available in the US and Canada though. It is run by Disney itself so it is legit.",1630886776
84,Pixar,I still haven‚Äôt finished the Toy Story 2 game on PlayStation from 20 years ago‚Ä¶,1630885800
85,Pixar,"Yes he does; that's why he caught my eye on the hook and why I got him, even though I never noticed him in the movie and had to look him up.",1630883967
86,Pixar,"Haha Existential jokes aside, he looks pretty cool!",1630882561
87,Pixar,"Faster than fast. 

Quicker than quick. 

Love these films! I‚Äôm so excited for the series.",1630882507
88,Pixar,I played this on the wii. I remember being at the last level before my disk got damaged‚Ä¶,1630880197
89,Pixar,Omg yes my favorite game of all time what I would pay for a remake,1630880003
90,Pixar,Are there more Pixar video games you‚Äôve enjoyed? I know there‚Äôs a lego Incredibles but I would‚Äôve like to see a four-player Incredibles beat ‚Äòem up game.,1630877981
91,Pixar,"The toy box mode was a big part of what made this game. The developers went all in on Disney infinity. However, Disney pulled the plug due to the ‚Äútoys to life‚Äù genre getting too competitive",1630877771
92,Pixar,[deleted],1630877736
93,Pixar,yeah that‚Äôs unfortunate. The steam version is also missing some features. Hopefully game services like Xbox game pass came help bring these games to current gen. I‚Äôve seen a good amount of Disney/Pixar games on PlayStation now.,1630877637
94,Pixar,Depending on your specs you can try to emulate the PS3 or 360 version! What's inside your PC?,1630877249
95,Pixar,"Apparently the port that they put on Steam isn‚Äôt the same as the console version which is unfortunate ,because I don‚Äôt own a 360 anymore. :(",1630876689
96,Pixar,The Cars 2 video game was also really dope,1630876185
97,Pixar,"I believe this. Toy Story 3 was the first Disney game to have the toybox mode, which would later come back for Infinity",1630875385
98,Pixar,Hell yea,1630874347
99,Pixar,"Yeah it really is a shame. Especially when they only use already made formats like candy crush or temple run-style games. What was so awesome about those games, too, was that there was so much extra story. They weren‚Äôt  just carbon copies of the movies",1630874293
0,Pixar,this is why they should keep making games. They gave fans fond memories in movies and video games. These days most movie games are apps rather than full blown titles,1630874172
1,Pixar,üëç. Cars series next year!,1630874090
2,Pixar,I loved the ratatouille game to be honest,1630873126
3,Pixar,KACHOW!!!!!!,1630873067
4,Pixar,All time best is the Ratatouille video game. This is is great too tho. So many memories of both.,1630873024
5,Pixar,can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve played that one but there have been plenty of fun Pixar video games. It‚Äôs too bad we don‚Äôt get as many anymore. They do make great companion pieces to the films,1630872282
6,Pixar,"Great game, although I think Toy Story 2 Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is just as good if not better, just held back by the graphics of its time",1630871500
7,Pixar,"I made a review going over the Toy Story 3 video game. Usually movie-tie in games are rushed products resulting in mediocre games. However, Disney was actually involved in the development of this game along with Pixar, giving fans one of the best Pixar video games. link  below

12,Pixar,"Disney itself is extremely broad. There‚Äôs Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disney TV Animation, and their live-action studios. That‚Äôs 3 different studios to create content vs Pixar being 1. Additionally the Marvel and Lucasfilm content is focused on being supplements to the MCU and building up future Star Wars movies. So for its place, I think Pixar is keeping up just fine.",1630852042

Only You story 2 and 3 managed that but yah I agree 4 was not really needed and they really ruined Bonnie's character for me, she seemed adorable in the 3 and I was happy Woody and the others got given to her in the end. To see her just toss Woody a side like that after what Andy said was just heart breaking.

It was just nice seeing the universe expand. Of course the animation quality suffered quite a lot, but maybe they'll have a bigger budget for season 2. I get why there's very mixed reviews on this. The show tries to relate to life in a workplace, but that sometimes falls flat due to the nature of the show being pretty kid friendly. I'd give it a low 7/10 if I'm being honest. I didn't like it much when it started but it grew on me a little bit.",1630529730

1) Cars (all three)

2) The Incredibles

4) Wall-e

If there is a season 2, Sulley won‚Äôt meet Boo again. The filmmakers [stated in an interview](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/fantasy/monsters-at-work-boo-newsupdate/) that they‚Äôll never do that in a sequel or series because they want the audience to decide for ourselves how that narrative goes instead of being told.

Additionally, in the timeline of events in the Monsters world, Boo‚Äôs door being fixed is still several months after the Monsters at Work season finale.",1630491123

For it not being made entirely by Pixar is a pretty impressive feat considering it's very mature dialogue and commentary on employment issues and not being able to take your desired career path, bot to mention the chemistry between the characters, the decision to push Mika and Sully towards the side and ensure that newer characters receive more development, was well as the surprisingly non-linear writing and nuanced plot beats.",1630431157

I don't think we have enough information yet to determine whether or not Lightyear is ""necessary"". Why is any film necessary for that matter? Seems like criticisms nowadays lack every amount of nuance and originality.",1630430614

The directors and crew seem pretty intent on telling good stories (which is what makes Pixar great!) and it‚Äôs the marketing guys that look after the merchandise and sales",1630337378
18,Pixar,"The only way it could work is if Toy Story was the central plot device. All the characters used would be toy versions of the characters. There are too many characters to make everyone a lead, but if they had Woody and Buzz meet The INCREDIBLES action figures, that would be fun. They end up in the bathroom where Nemo, Dori, and Marlin are bath toys. Cars could easily be worked into that scenario. Sulley and Mike Wazowski are stuffed animals in another bedroom. It writes itself.",1630336323
19,Pixar,Maybe an anthology movie.  That‚Äôs what‚Äôs I was thinking.  Not a serious movie but a fun one where they can sell lots of merchandise.  It‚Äôs also a great way to tie in all the characters.,1630326542
20,Pixar,"I doubt it would make sense, unless you're thinking of something more sandbox or non-canon, just for the sake of making it. Sounds like a fun idea, but I don't think they'd make a movie out of it.

A game would be more likely, but even then, there'd be no easy way to narrow down what kind of gameplay to use. The characters are too varied, we got cars, regular people, and all sorts of animals and toys.

24,Pixar,"I would like for them to full-on make something for adults someday. Like it wouldn't even necessarily need to even be PG-13, it could still be a PG movie that's more serious, Soul is pretty close to this but I have to admit the middle of the movie &gt;!where he's a cat!&lt; was my least favorite part of it, it felt like they put that in there to keep kids entertained. That said, I still didn't find that part bad, I was just thinking that they have the ability to write stories that adults could find more enjoyable. Another example would be if they made a whole movie like the beginning of Up. That said for the most part they strike a good balance between both kids and adults liking their movies, I just think it could be interesting if they aimed more for adults.

A PG-13 movie could also be interesting, I think a third Incredibles movie taking that route or a WALL-E prequel with the Earth dying would be a really interesting idea. On top of this, Disney often puts out movies the same year as Pixar anyway and I'd say Disney's generally the more kid focused ones so even if Pixar put out a movie that younger kids didn't like, there would still eventually be a Disney movie that they could see.",1630298615
25,Pixar,"After recently rewatching both, I don't just think the sequel is better, I think it's a standout top 3 Pixar work alongside Monsters Inc and Toy Story 3. I connect to the messages and characters of the film much more, the plot is less contrived, and the visuals are stellar.

Helen's arc is so powerful for me, and Bob fills the comic relief role amazingly without detracting from his heroism. I love the way Screenslaver contrasts with everything Syndrome was, and I love how they didn't just go ""okay, supers are back, everything's cool now!"" like the original ending implied.

59,Pixar,"Perhaps an unpopular opinion here, but the show has grown on me big time. I found the first two episodes decently enjoyable, but after that, it‚Äôs felt like a hilarious workplace comedy with an amusing cast characters. 

I love Val‚Äôs comedically aggressive positivity (Mindy Kaling was perfectly cast here); Duncan‚Äôs wild paranoia about his job and inexplicable mid-century mid-Atlantic accent (‚Äúover here, college boyyyy!‚Äù); Cutter‚Äôs morbid conversational asides; Fritz as an overeager parental figure. The brief little voiceover clips at the end of the credits (‚Äúthe moral is, Never remove a doohickey‚Äù).

70,Pixar,"Of course he‚Äôs not gonna be thrilled about not being played with, but he never lets it stop him from being there for Bonnie. He stows away to kindergarten in Bonnie‚Äôs backpack, not because he wants attention, but because he is genuinely worried about Bonnie. He could‚Äôve easily come out of the backpack and taken all the glory for himself, but instead he stays hidden and helps her find courage on her own by creating Forky. He is also dealing with a sense of purposelessness because he is no longer the leader of the room like he used to be with Andy. And he feels like he fulfilled his purpose through Andy and that he can‚Äôt provide the same thing for another child. 

I think you‚Äôre seriously misinterpreting the previous movies. Woody doesn‚Äôt go back to Andy in Toy Story 2 because he is obligated to. He goes back because he *wants* to. Because he realizes that Andy‚Äôs love for him, and his love for Andy, is too important to him. Even though their love won‚Äôt last forever it means more to him than a lifetime being admired at a museum. He knows that Andy will outgrow a need for him one day, but Woody still wants to be there for as long as he can be. He is willing to go through the heartbreak of abandonment if it means he can feel the genuine love of a child first. That‚Äôs what Toy Story 2 (and all of the TS movies) is all about. Love, not loyalty. The genuine, *mutual* bond between a child and a toy. Andy loved Woody in TS 1-3. Bonnie did not love Woody anymore by TS4. Loyalty was always just a side result of their mutual love, but it has never been the main focus. 

In Toy Story 3, Woody‚Äôs arc is about learning to let go and move on from Andy. Woody spends the first 2/3 or so of the movie unwilling to accept anything other than Andy, but learns and grows to accept that it‚Äôs time to move on by the end. Andy was willing to keep Woody and take him to college. Woody made the choice to put himself in the box that was being donated to Bonnie. He was the one who wrote the note to give Andy the idea to donate the rest of the toys in the first place. If his character was really all about ‚Äúloyalty for the sake of loyalty‚Äù then he would‚Äôve stayed with Andy and gone to college with him. And he wouldn‚Äôt let the other toys stay in the attic where Andy intended not have written the note to be donated to Bonnie. 

*Abandoning* and *going separate ways * is a massive difference. Do you ‚Äúabandon‚Äù your parents when you move out of their house when you grow older? No of course not. It would only be abandonment if the other characters needed him around and were actively encouraging him to stay, but he chose to leave anyway. But they all clearly give him their blessing to go.

Why wouldn‚Äôt Buzz allow his friend to leave? Are you trying to say that Buzz is a selfish and/or emotionally immature character who would prevent his friend from pursuing new opportunities just because he couldn‚Äôt be there? He didn‚Äôt try to stop Woody from leaving Sunnyside in TS3. The only reason Buzz scolds Woody in TS2 is because he felt hurt. He traveled who knows how far and put himself and the rest of the group at risk to rescue Woody thinking he was in danger only to realize that Woody was planning to leave forever. He was hurt and lashing out. And even then he does actually leave without Woody. It‚Äôs also important to point out that being owned and played with by a child was the only lifestyle that Buzz (or any of the main toys) have experienced at that point. Each movie is opening up the main characters to new ideas and perspectives. It is not a bad thing for movies to challenge pre-existing beliefs or ideas. It‚Äôs what makes movies interesting and dynamic.",1630207049
71,Pixar,"I‚Äôm excited for any Pixar movie. 

I‚Äôve heard people say that it‚Äôs not Pixar standard or that they aren‚Äôt excited for it. The teaser doesn‚Äôt answer many questions and it feels like a very linear story. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what a teaser is supposed to do, though. 

I‚Äôm going to wait for the actual full trailer to see if I‚Äôm actually excited for it, but I‚Äôll watch it either way.",1630200216
72,Pixar,"Ok that was a mistake, not being the favorite wasn't _the_ reason he left; but he was getting very uptight about it at the beginning, something he seemed to get over in TS1. 

The whole plot of TS2 was Woody learning to stick it out with his kid, even if it seemed he might be happier elsewhere. Even if he wasn't getting played with. Yes, just for the sake of being ""loyal."" This was continued in TS3, where he's adamant about returning, for better or worse. Guess he doesn't care what Andy wanted though when he entrusted the toys to Bonnie. 

I don't take issue with him fiercely protecting Forky, that's 100% in-character. It's his final decision that's the problem. You're making a distinction without a difference; ""abandons,"" ""lets go of,"" whatever, point is, after spending the whole movie fighting to get Forky (some kindergarten craft garbage that will surely be lost/discarded within the year), he ~~abandons~~ [""gives up by leaving or ceasing to operate or inhabit""] all his friends and the child he was entrusted to, because he thinks he won't be missed. Post-TS2 Woody wouldn't do that. Post-TS2 Buzz wouldn't just let him.

This of course brings us to Buzz, who was likely more out of character than Woody. Plainly speaking, he's a dumbass in this movie. He's been aware of his toy nature for like 3
2 movies and a few shorts now, he's well aware that his buttons are merely voice lines from his toy-persona, but suddenly he's as clueless as Drax and takes figures of speech literally? He literally relies on his voice box for major decisions, one of which is abandoning Woody and Forky at the antique store. The same Buzz who spent all of TS2 tracking down Woody, leaving a toy behind, and letting (encouraging even) a toy give up on his kid.",1630194087

74,Pixar,"Did you watch 4? You can‚Äôt seriously think Woody leaves because he isn‚Äôt the favorite or isn‚Äôt being played with unless you are purposely pushing for that narrative. The movie makes it incredibly clear that Woody isn‚Äôt upset or jealous about not being played with. He actively goes out of his way to protect and rescue Forky and make sure he is around when Boonie needed him.

Woody was loyal to Bonnie until the end. He didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúaBaNdOn‚Äù anyone. He only leaves after getting reassurance that Bonnie will be well taken care of. Once he returned Forky he had nothing left to offer Bonnie. His playtime role as the sheriff had been taken by Jessie. He was being forgotten and hardly even noticed or acknowledged. Sure he could stay with Bonnie just for the sake of being ‚Äúloyal‚Äù but he can do so much more good by leaving with Bo and helping other lost toys and children.",1630191431

I certainly agree that LucasFilm should collaborate, it just makes sense. Not so sure on the Star Wars Pixar movie though.

Thankfully it doesn't last too long after Bob decides to prove himself to be a good father, especially by staying up night reading through Dash's math book. Also I agreed with Evelyn that their parents going to the safe room would have been a much better often trying to call supers right after they were banished when their house was invaded.

Its bold it takes the original premise of Toy Story and flips it and it makes sense because you can see Woody's character slowly getting to this point throughout the series. Especially in TS3.

Additionally, they seem to be going for a ‚Äúgo up and act your age‚Äù message for Mater‚Ä¶only to drop that and tell Mater to be himself in the last act. They had a cool idea and message that they almost sort of conveyed, but they sort of chickened out at the last second.

29,Pixar,"Just finished watching and I loved it. It's absolutely beautifully animated, very well written and well paced. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up watching it again in the near future.",1629780510
30,Pixar,[removed],1629777071
31,Pixar,"It was ok. My dad and I, who are huge fans of Disney and Pixar (Tangled and Ratatouile are two of his favorite movies, and the Incredibles is a masterpiece), but this, along with Raya, just felt like tech demos with how basic and bland their stories and characters were, when technically speaking the Toy Story movies are Pixar and Dinsay's tech demos (I mean, why did you think they released one whenever there was a big leap in technology). These movies were both visual treats that I would gladly watch again just for how amazing they look, but without that, you have rushed and under-developed relationships in the case of Luca and generic ""Everything changed when the Fire Nation Attacked"" story with Raya, and both movies' protagonists are basically unmodified versions of their character archetype. Overall, I'm giving both 6/10s. Good for a watch if you just got a new tv or something and want to see how good the picture is, but even then, Toy Story 4 or Soul are probably better ways to go in that department.",1629774792
32,Pixar,"Agree about 3 being the perfect ending, but I still thought 4 was very well done. This post says it could‚Äôve been better but I‚Äôm not sure how since the biggest flaw with it is that it was unnecessary you know lol",1629774212
33,Pixar,I still think The Good Dinosaur was worse.,1629773617

38,Pixar,"2006 and Car's was mostly done by then. They still made some good stuff right after they were bought too like Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3. That said, most of those were probably in production when Disney bought them, it seemed like they got worse in the early 2010's.",1629772788
39,Pixar,"The first Cars movie isn‚Äôt that bad, it‚Äôs pretty good actually besides the premise of talking cars being really stupid, and I have a soft spot for Monsters University.",1629772231

43,Pixar,Where'd you get that Luca steelbook,1629768650
44,Pixar,If Luca was made in 2001...,1629768553
45,Pixar,"
For me personally, I don't like that &gt;!Gabby was given the voice box at the end of the film!&lt;

This seems to imply that Gabby really wouldn't be loved by a child unless her ""disability"" was fixed. I don't like the message this plot point is sending. In real life, disabilities are rarely overcome so easily, and a disability doesn't need to be ""fixed"" for someone to have worth.

I think the end of the movie would have been so much more impactful if Gabby was found by a child with a speech impediment, who could relate to Gabby's faulty voice box. Or she could have been found by a hard-of-hearing child who doesn't mind if a toy can talk or not.

I still really like Toy Story 4, and it's still a good movie despite this complaint. The end of Gabby's plot line is just what I think could benefit most from a change.",1629766911
46,Pixar,"I have always hoped it wasn‚Äôt happening, and here it is. A leak of the live action",1629764281
47,Pixar,What do people have against Toy Story 4?,1629763996
48,Pixar,You‚Äôre wrong,1629763966
49,Pixar,Incredibles 2 no doubt. It‚Äôs a fine movie and all but it could‚Äôve been so much more.,1629762928
50,Pixar,"Thank you very much, Glad it made you smile &lt;3",1629761228
51,Pixar,"She's a discount Mulan, but Mulan was impersonating a man and she was an actually likeable and strong character. Merida is just one dimensional",1629760575
52,Pixar,"I have to disagree with most of this, for me she's the best disney princess because she's the only official one that doesn't have, need or want a man. I've never seen or heard of brother bear so can't touch on that. She's suppose to be a bratty teenager so yeah. Personally I loved the movie and keep my hatred for the good dinosaur and finding dory",1629760474

64,Pixar,Luca needs to be there so boring and weak for a pixar film,1629750410
65,Pixar,"Sorry but I loved Cars, Cars 3 and Monsters University as they are, but I agree that Cars 2, Finding Dory, Incredibles 2 and especially Brave and The Good Dinosaur should've been better.",1629750012
66,Pixar,Are you okay?,1629749960
67,Pixar,"I like most of Cars, but it was definitely too long. They could have trimmed it down a bit. 
When I was around 6 years old, I was in a test audience for an early version of the movie and I fell asleep about halfway through. 

Cars is long for an animated film. I think it‚Äôs almost 2 hours, if not longer. I wish Onward was that long instead. :P",1629749851
68,Pixar,"Brave is definitely my least favorite Pixar movie. I don‚Äôt like it all. It felt so bland and unfinished, like an outline of something better. Seemed more like an older Disney Princess movie than a Pixar one. 

And I agree about Merida being whiny. She was so annoying.",1629749472
69,Pixar,"Wow I need to rewatch cars: pessimists, imbeciles and dickheads? Sounds great!!",1629749118
70,Pixar,"I seriously am bias towards Brave. Merida is the worst Disney princess and Pixar protagonist. I know what Pixar was trying to put a female-lead roles in their movies, but this was just in poor effort. Most of the characters are useless and completely unsympathetic, even the ones we are supposed to root for, the jokes are what you expect in a run of the mill Adam Sandler film, and the storyline is just half a ripoff of Brother Bear, yeah BROTHER BEAR! the most forgotten Disney movie of all time. Merida is a whiny, brat. She does have an interesting concept of women's rights, but she is SOOO unlikeable. For example, she NEVER said sorry to her mother FOR TURNING HER AND MERIDA'S SIBLINGS INTO A BEAR! and claims it's not her fault. The only thing I like about this movie is the animation, the settings and environments are beautiful and the water Is pretty, I just don't know how this could be wasted on this derivative, awful piece of sh*t movie. F*ck Brave, F*ck Merida, F*ck Pixar, F*ck the screenwriters, f*ck the screenwriters' mothers and F*ck the Oscars for chosing THIS MOVIE over Wreck It Ralph, WRECK IT RALPH.",1629747762
71,Pixar,"Onward was hella disappointing, they had a great world and good characters and barely did anything with it",1629747717

73,Pixar,[deleted],1629746373
74,Pixar,"I kinda like Cars and I think it's a classic, but It could've been another Pixar Gem, considering Pixar dominated animated movies in the 2000s",1629746160
75,Pixar,I love cars personally,1629746033
76,Pixar,[deleted],1629745958
77,Pixar,I liked brave but I must admit I find my attention waning midway,1629745936
78,Pixar,"Exactly. The movie is dumb, Mater is so out of character and it contributes NOTHING to the Franchise and the new characters and events are watered down by Cars 3",1629745909
79,Pixar,Luca is perfect. Theyres nothing wrong with it. It has pretty animation and the characters are likeable. Also Luca is so adorable! ü•∞,1629745697
80,Pixar,I really think that Cars 2 _could‚Äôve_ been great and that it actually had potential to _be_ great. But the problem is that the people behind it put no effort into making an actual good script because all that really mattered was that toys were selling.,1629745597
81,Pixar,I do love Brave. And I'll swap it for Luca.,1629745331
82,Pixar,"I loved Brave and Monsters University, tbh, but I agree that they could‚Äôve had some better plotlines and characters.",1629744544
83,Pixar,"Although it's not a popular opinion, I fully agree with you",1629743930
84,Pixar,Loo,1629743910
85,Pixar,"Cars has a LOT of filler. It's supposed to be an animated racecar film, but 70% of the movie was just Lightning McQueen in an abandoned town full of  pessimists, imbeciles and dickheads",1629743868
86,Pixar,I don‚Äôt think Cars or Monsters University need to be improved.,1629743691
87,Pixar,"It is. 

The first Cars became Pixar's first letdown, the reviews were weaker by 20% and became the studio's trashy franchise

Cars 2 came along and became the worst Pixar film of all time, recieving a 40% on Rotten Tomatoes and continued a long streak of bad movies

Cars 3 followed and was dismissed as a weak, Mediocore but fun family film by audiences who were unenthusiastic by the reception of Cars 2. It's still a good movie, but not by Pixar standards",1629743631
88,Pixar,I'm sorry. I thought it was a perfect movie and it sums up why dory was alone,1629743333
89,Pixar,fair enough. I was definitely a little disappointed but i think it‚Äôs a good enough show for its target audience,1629742497
90,Pixar,The second half of Up can be on this list,1629741260
91,Pixar,"i would add finding dory and erase toy story 4, also add onward altough it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt bad. also i don‚Äôt remember a bugs life so idk",1629741032
92,Pixar,So you just think that the cars trilogy is disappointing,1629740755
93,Pixar,I know I do!,1629740725
94,Pixar,You don't think Finding Dory could have been better?,1629740649
95,Pixar,"Again, Woody did not ABANDON Bonnie. He decided to let her go in the end. See, there‚Äôs a difference in what you said. The reason why Woody chose to go back with Andy in Toy Story 2 was because he knew he was still needed at the time. 

Also, Buzz knows what his buttons are, and he thought Woody meant that your ‚Äúinner voice‚Äù MEANT those buttons. Again, he was not stupid.",1629738438
96,Pixar,"... so he abandoned Bonnie because Buzz told him it'd be alright? I'm sorry, but if Buzx thinks he should listen to his voice box for advice, he's stupid. Buzz was only this ignorant in the first movie, when he didn't believe he was a toy; he's been fully aware of his artificial nature for like 2 1/4 movies now. In Toy Story 2 he even scolds Woody for being selfish and wanting to leave. Tells him about a toy's greatest purpose, being loved by a kid. So much for that. You know what? Screw your kid, if he/she doesn't play with you enough, just leave!

They 100% went back on their characterization and themes. Buzz is now too dense to grasp what Woody's saying. And now Woody is all insecure because he might not be the favorite... again.",1629736783
97,Pixar,Scud is realizing you only have 4 hours of free time before you need to go to bed to get up on time the next day.,1629736653
98,Pixar,Same,1629736465
99,Pixar,My first time realising they have the carpet from The Shining,1629736344
0,Pixar,"Maybe to keep him interesting, he should‚Äôve kept having other delusions. He was always the idealist",1629736000
1,Pixar,It would have been better if it focused on McQueen going through the tough transition from racing against cars in his region to racing against some of the best in the world. I also think there should have been 1 race in each continent rather than just Europe and Japan. The whole spy thing should have been saved for a spin off Mater's Tall Tale movie.,1629733987
2,Pixar,That actually looks really accurate. Good job!,1629731454
3,Pixar,"Aww, this is so cute!! Made me laugh :D awesome animation too!!",1629730514
4,Pixar,"Just not my thing. Fairly boring to me, overrated.",1629730514

10,Pixar,I can‚Äôt wait for light year to come out,1629722138
11,Pixar,"Dear pixar, please take notes",1629722059
12,Pixar,"Each movie has a ""straight man"". Toy story already has Woody so they needed to try something else with Buzz",1629722003
13,Pixar,"It's because that ""doesn't realize he's a toy"" dynamic was so central to the premise of his character and there wasn't much to do beyond that. 

I don't think it's as bad as you suggest though, the persona is still fun and the second film in particular flips the script and has him be the foil that Woody was to him in the first.",1629720902
14,Pixar,I can‚Äôt remember where but I‚Äôm 80% sure someone from Pixar has pretty much said this. They‚Äôve had a hard time keeping buzz interesting once he knows he‚Äôs a toy so they have to reset him or something and get him back to that place,1629720332
15,Pixar,"Yup! Most excited I‚Äôve been for a Pixar project in a while, despite the lack of information so far.",1629718952
16,Pixar,"Yes, I always knew that. But this is stilla Walt Disney TV Animation show, and as such, I still expected it being good as their other shows of recent years, especially since it took longer time to come. But it wasn't, it was all disappointing...",1629713513
17,Pixar,If they did three before two it would make sense. I say this because sterling has a picture of miles axle rod in his office. So if like Finn and holly were under cover or something and left the building chasing sterling and Mater was like‚Äù hmm this is a time to show my backwards racing‚Äù or something like that and ends up on the plane it would be good,1629710601
18,Pixar,You forgot the upcoming film: Lightyear - Buzz is an actual space ranger!,1629703792
19,Pixar,"His role in the first three was clever and the one in the fourth ranged from kind of funny to pointless.

I‚Äôd like to see a show showing Buzz and Jessie trying to lead the toys since they got shafted last film.",1629701880
20,Pixar,"should‚Äôve lowered your expectations as soon as you learned pixar wasn‚Äôt making it. 

you made this post knowing pixar didn‚Äôt make it, right?

‚Ä¶right?",1629698049
21,Pixar,"‚Äúmediocre‚Äù and ‚Äúnot as good as the original‚Äù = suck? 

i actually agree with most of your opinions, other than MU/Finding Dory (swap them), but your title is a little misleading.",1629697949
22,Pixar,"Toy Story 2 and 3 were really giifl but I wish 4 hadn't been made, it just seemed like a waste of time that could have been better used on another movie.

Increidbles 2 was enjoyable but inferior to the first one.

I wish rhe others just didn't exist.",1629697440
23,Pixar,"Clearly _you‚Äôre_ the one who didn‚Äôt watch 4. Because first of all, Woody did not ABANDON his kid at the end. Buzz allowed Woody to stay with Bo by saying that Bonnie will be just fine without him. And Buzz only listened to his voice box because he took Woody‚Äôs advice about your ‚Äúinner voice‚Äù too literal, not because he was stupid.",1629690225
24,Pixar,"Yea, I absolutely hate this movie. It‚Äôs boring and feels three hours long when it‚Äôs actually one of the shortest Pixar films.",1629689592
25,Pixar,"Did you watch 4? You can't seriously think that's what staying loyal to his kid looks like lol. He abandons her because he's not her favorite and hasn't been played with for a few days, something he supposedly got over in the *first* movie. Buzz abandons his friend... because his _voice box_ told him to, so much for ""To infinity and beyond"" I guess. Since when is Buzz retarded enough to listen to his factory voice lines for advice?",1629689330
26,Pixar,"That‚Äôs not at all what they did. They still stay true to those themes throughout, such as Woody staying loyal to his kid.",1629688850
27,Pixar,"It was though, until they decided it wasn't and 180'ed on the whole theme of the trilogy and the lessons Woody &amp; co. had learned.",1629688470
28,Pixar,"I don‚Äôt think they could keep the spies element without it being bad unless it was just at the very end maybe? The biggest problem is that the film focuses around Mater. Change that, I honestly don‚Äôt know how to change that, but if it was more focused on Lightning McQueen it would be better",1629688320
29,Pixar,Unpopular Opinion: I despise Finding Dory. It‚Äôs objectively not the worst Pixar film but it‚Äôs the one I hate the most,1629687401

31,Pixar,"The Franchise could've ended with Toy Story 3. Andy left for college and he leaves all of his toys with a little girl. That ending in Toy Story 3 made me believe that that would've been the end of the Franchise, but noooooooooooooo, Pixar and it's stupid sequel streak made THIS cinematic abomination",1629681758
32,Pixar,Toy Story 4 was not at all unnecessary,1629681574
33,Pixar,Such a good short!!,1629681438
34,Pixar,It‚Äôs perfectly fine IMO. Nothing special but I do enjoy sitting down and watching it every week. The stuff with the existing characters is far superior to Tylor and the MIFT crew shenanigans though.,1629677702
35,Pixar,Thank you for this! She has such a wonderful expression.,1629677229
36,Pixar,"Agreed. I hope you don‚Äôt mind if I share my opinions on the sequels.
- I agree with you on Finding Dory and Incredibles 2 and while I liked Toy Story 4, I do agree that it was unnecessary.
- I think that Monsters University is the most underrated Pixar movie after Cars.
- I like Cars 3 and I don‚Äôt think Cars 2 is as bad as most say it is. It could be because Cars is my all time favourite movie and I just like them because of the nostalgia.",1629676431
37,Pixar,Better than the original,1629673474
38,Pixar,"Did you think they better, worse, or on the same level as the original?",1629673447
39,Pixar,They were good too,1629673351
40,Pixar,What about Toy Story 2 and 3?,1629673334
41,Pixar,"Haha love the ""pointless third season"" part we all hate season 3 of BH6",1629670506
42,Pixar,I was enjoying it a little bit at first but I can't help but be bored while watching each episode now.,1629670452

But the Yeti episode was heartwarming",1629668177
45,Pixar,"Gravity Falls, Amphibia, Ducktales and The Owl House are all kids shows, and they're FAR more engaging than this boring thing. And even the serieses of Tangled and Big Hero 6 (not counting the pointless third season) were far better... As someone who has loved Disney's animated shows for years in the last decade, I expected much more, especially since this was a series dedicated to one of the best Pixar Movies...",1629666512
46,Pixar,I think you should lower your standards a bit for a kids show. I‚Äôve been watching with my 10 month old son and it‚Äôs been a great experience.,1629665504
47,Pixar,Thank you!,1629664327
48,Pixar,"I just came out of a 14 hour flight, had the first six episodes of the show downloaded to watch.

I felt so warm and happy watching them. Seeing my favorite movie getting a pseudo-sequel, reminded me of how I squeeled when I saw Mike and Sully in Kingdom Hearts 3. I don‚Äôt get the hate, it‚Äôs a great show that pays huge respect to its predecessors. Sure it‚Äôs not as high budget but what do you expect. I‚Äôll be so sad if the show gets canceled before Tylor gets his promotion.",1629663625
49,Pixar,You captured her spunkiness!,1629662487
50,Pixar,As a male in his 20s (not the main target audience) I have really enjoyed this show and think it has severed as a decent continuation of this franchise. All the MIFTers outside of Tylor are fun and enjoyable. Last episode even served as a great basis as an attraction for the theme parks. I would say that this show has out competed some of their shows they expected to perform better like the Bad Batch.,1629661515
51,Pixar,Thank you for your kind words!,1629661188
52,Pixar,The other guy here,1629657138
53,Pixar,"Sure but you can pick apart a lot of movies like that. Granted the world building for Cars is probably particularly undercooked, but think about the mechanics of like Toy Story for more than 10 minutes and it falls apart. How do the toys always get back to exactly where they were in time, why does Buzz freeze if he's not a toy, how has no other toy talked to a human before and that human spread the news, why are toys cool with inevitably ending up in landfills one day, can they die, are they immortal?

 But we don't care about that stuff because its telling a good story that we enjoy. It becomes very easy to pick apart Cars 2 that way because, most of us don't like the story so the issues with the world become more apparent

Oh wow I saw Turbo but haven't thought about it in so long. It had a show right?",1629657133
54,Pixar,Lol. Pete Docter‚Äôs films all have some little inconsistencies and things that don‚Äôt make sense. They really don‚Äôt distract too much from the movies though.,1629653360

65,Pixar,Pixar uses proprietary software to animate their projects. Programs like Renderman and Presto are the two I‚Äôm aware of.,1629638320

71,Pixar,"They probably will eventually but not until a substantial number of shorts have been released theatrically or on Blu-rays (post-2018). Lately they‚Äôve been doing SparkShorts instead of theatrical shorts and all of their feature-based shorts are going straight to Disney+ instead of Blu-rays, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect it for a while since I‚Äôm expecting this trend to continue, unless of course Disney decides to release their Disney+ original content onto Blu-ray/Digital.

Assuming that Disney+ content is never released to Blu-ray/Digital, the only short that‚Äôs been released since or around the same time as Volume 3 that wasn‚Äôt a Disney+ Original is Auntie Edna, so they‚Äôd probably need at least 9 more theatrical/Blu-ray shorts until Volume 4 happens (past volumes have had 12-13 shorts each but 10 would be probably an acceptable number for most people).",1629611706

73,Pixar,"I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs wherever these deleted scenes came from I‚Äôm pretty sure, or some other source.

81,Pixar,"I like to see a prequel to Coco! Show what H√©ctor‚Äôs life was like before he got poisoned by Ernesto. Show Hector how he became a musician, how he met Ernesto, how he met Imelda. It would be fun to see Hector and Imelda falling in love as young (and alive) people. 
The prequel could also display some things from Imelda‚Äôs perspective like what made her think that Hector abandoned her. I always wonder why didn‚Äôt she wrote to Ernesto asking him about Hector or why didn‚Äôt she call the police to file out a mission person. We can also see the scene in which Hector tried to reunite with Imelda in the Land of the Dead in the 1970s, but she turned him away (would explain why in the movie, he cared about only seeing Coco, but not Coco AND Imelda). To have the movie end on a happy note, it could skip to  Imelda and Hector reconciling after sending Miguel home and then cut to the next scene in which H√©ctor spends Dia Dos Muertos with Imelda while watching Miguel play his guitar.",1629585075
82,Pixar,Is it made by a Pixar employee? Enrico Casarosa does give away details like this,1629584575
83,Pixar,"That would actually be interesting but too dark for Pixar to seriously consider making.

The short 'Monster Truk Mater' actually did have a Frankenstien-like monster in it but those were just implied to be stuff Mater was making up.",1629583910
84,Pixar,"Several could work pretty well.

Toy Story; No more sequels please but a prequel showing Woody's origin could be interesting.

Monsters Inc; I know there's Monsters at Work which I haven't seen yet but it doesn't appear to be going down the path I would take. I think it would be interesting with Boo getting older, like maybe a teenager or something and coming back to the monster world.

The Incredibles; A prequel would be cool (honestly a villian of the week series set before the super hero ban could work well on Disney+) but I was kinda dissappointed the sequel took place immediantly after the first movie. I was kind hoping there would be a 5-6 year time skip with Violet in college, Dash being a teen and Jack Jack learning to control his powers.

WALL-E; this would work great for both. I think I would prefer a prequel showing how bad Earth was getting and everybody leaving but a sequel where they rebuild society would be interesting.

Inside Out; would work well with a sequel, it would be kinda funny for it to be longer version of that date short.

Luca; It would be interesting if they did a year time skip and made it into more of a teen drama as that feels like a natural progression.",1629583719

It‚Äôs definitely not one of those movies where it ends and you feel like that‚Äôs all there is to see/there‚Äôs no more story to tell. They could even do a tv show with this if they wanted to.

78,Pixar,"That's a great idea. Also, once puberty hits, there are way more emotions, which could be used as new characters to spice things up. All that being said though, I feel like the first movie is so good that I don't want it ruined by a bad sequel",1629484937

Some of them like Finding Dory or Monsters University are still fairly enjoyable, but are still ultimately disposal. 

Even though I was extremely disappointed by Incredibles 2, a small part of me still wants to see a proper sequel set years later. I want to see the kids older and struggling with more adult themes and issues like in the original. Other than that I don‚Äôt think Pixar should do any more sequels for films that have been released.

96,Pixar,"I feel like it would be storm, because (get ready for this, here comes some information from an F1 addict) Francesco is an F1 car.

Those cars struggle A LOT with dirty air (the f'd up airflow coming from a car in front).

Dirty air makes following a car from behind really hard for them because both the engine heats up more, and they lose downforce (basically the opposite of the forces that make an airplane lift up)

If the engine gets too hot it can blow up, that's why, if you watch F1, you can often see that if someone is within a second of another driver for a long time, they often let the gap extend to 1.5 or even 2 seconds, so the engine can cool down.

Alongside that the loss of downforce makes it harder to go through corners, since you'll be having a loss of grip. The more grip a car has on the road, the faster it'll be able to go through corners. Usually good drivers can still drive the same line as when they're driving freely, but that will result in faster tyre degridation, meaning they will have to make pit-stops earlier, which, in real F1, can result in a time loss of in between 20 to 25 seconds, depending on the length of the pitlane.


A car like Jackson Storm has less effect of the above mentioned problems, causing him to be able to follow more easily. Thanks to this he can stay right behind someone for longer, meaning he should be able to get a lot more oppertunities at overtaking Francesco than Francesco has on him.",1629479938

38,Pixar,"It's possible that they all had dumb phones/flip phones or something like that assuming they even had cell phones. I doubt Miguel would have been allowed a smartphone at least due to the ability to play music on it. Maybe the parents had enough control to have smartphones though but never listen to music on it.

As for TV, I doubt it was banned (though it's possible as we never see one in their house to my knowledge) but they definitely wouldn't have watched music programs on it and they probably would have muted the credits, maybe even the theme songs to shows, I kinda wish they had shown this to be honest.",1629353097
39,Pixar,"I really don't feel like they're trying to make us empathize with Tylor /that/ much. Of course, I haven't been keeping up with the show lately. But I feel like they're going to end the show with Tylor staying with the MIFTers, despite his obvious resentment of the position, because there are enough hints to his need to grow and develop into a better person, characteristically. And I bet they're going to showcase that by him selflessly accepting a full-time position with the rest of the MIFT crew. I heavily disagree with this potential decision, though, mainly because I hate how overbearing and clingy the rest of the MIFTers are, especially with how they reacted to ""Banana Bread"" leaving and how they refuse to listen to Tylor when he constantly says that his position is temporary.",1629352900

52,Pixar,"I actually really liked it!! When it first came out, I read some reviews about it before seeing it and expected it to be pretty bad based on those reviews. It turned out to be WAY better than people made it sound like. It could just be because I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm a sucker for ‚Äúcharacter who‚Äôs scared of everything goes through hell to get something they need/want and changes into a badass along the way‚Äù stories, but I saw it with my mom, stepdad, step-grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousins (who were about 10 years old) and we all liked it. So it‚Äôs definitely not the terrible low effort mess people make it sound like. personally the only Pixar movie I actively DON‚ÄôT LIKE or wouldn‚Äôt choose to watch is Cars 2 lol.",1629303204
53,Pixar,"I think it‚Äôs because of the characters. There‚Äôs just something so CHARMING about them that you can‚Äôt help but love it.

60,Pixar,September 1!,1629282696
61,Pixar,"As a kid I loved The Incredibles and that's one of the few things I loved as a kid that I love even better as an adult, I didn't understand the whole aspect to Mrs Parr thinking her husband was cheating on her in the movie which makes the scene where she slaps Mirage funnier now. 

Ratatouille looked kinda weird and boring to me, I watched it once as a kid and wasn't really impressed, however with me being an adult now, I think it's really good.

I like WALL-E pretty much the same but I now think about how the first half doesn't really have any dialogue and I think that's pretty interesting now, it's very uncommon to see that in a mainstream animated film. 

Car's went down the most for me, now I still think it's a pretty good movie but I was obsessed with that movie back when I was 10 and would watch it almost every day. Now I mostly think about how the universe doesn't make any sense but I can still enjoy the movie really well and it does touch on some interesting history.

Up is another one that somewhat went down for me, I still like it a lot and the beginning is still incredible but I do kinda find the later parts like with the dogs flying the planes goofier now, still a solid movie though.

I preferred Toy Story 1 as a kid but interestingly I prefer 2 now, both are still excellent though and I don't like them any less now.

A Bug's Life I was always kind of like ""This is okay"" on and I still hold that opinion.

I loved Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo just as much as I did when I was a kid.

Toy Story 3 came out when I was 14 and I'm going to quit listing them now as my opinion hasn't changed on any of them that I've seen since then, I guess since I was viewing them more like an adult. I still liked the rest of their movies except The Good Dinosaur though and I definitely wouldn't have liked Soul as well if I had seen it as a kid though I think I would have still liked it.",1629262960
62,Pixar,"That movie would have been very PG-13 (actually, that scene with the crushed car at the beginning would have been full-on R) if you replaced the cars with humans which is pretty crazy to think about. I'm actually amazed that movie didn't end up with a PG. Anyway, I liked it but I would have never thought a sequel to the first movie would have involved spies blowing each other up.",1629261963
63,Pixar,"I like it pretty decently but I have to objectively say it's pretty average but that said, I still like it better than The Good Dinosaur (that's the only Pixar movie I actually really dislike) that said, it's still entertaining, honestly if Dreamworks or Illumination had made it I think people still would have said it wasn't great but probably wouldn't have really thought about it much, it just stood out for being bad to people because Pixar had an excellent track record and so when they made something that felt like more of a generic kids movie it was a let down to many teens and adults as well as film critics.

That said by kids movie standards it's still pretty decent, I think it's better than some stuff Illumination, Dreamworks and especially Sony Animation has made granted they all have some movies that I also think are better.",1629261698
64,Pixar,"The thing is, we can see the cars building an interstate in the first movie so they can build roads, also a lot of the buildings like in Tokyo in the sequel for example are very modern looking but if the cars took over in the early 1900's than humans wouldn't have built these, it seems like the cars and forklifts somehow made them.

As for reproduction, it's really unclear, many cars are real world makes and models and with stuff like Mack saying ""Thank the manufacturer you're alive"" would imply they are built but they can also have parents, maybe parents can have a kid built like in the Blue Sky's *Robots* movie for example. Then again if cars can actually reproduce it would actually explain why a lot of generic cars exist in that universe that aren't any real makes or models as they would be cross breeds (Pixar probably just did that for the extra characters so they wouldn't need to license as many real cars out though however by the time they made the sequel most extras were real cars anyway.) 

Then again the credits of the second movie seem to imply that cars have always existed in the universe as they show a carified version of the Terracotta Army for example.",1629261159

Also, I don't judge if anyone see Luca and Alberto as a couple. I used to see them as beautiful friendship, but they look so cute together. I believe what made this movie so popular is the ship Luca and Alberto, because everyone loves a sweet romance.",1629151067

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen theories on how Luca and Alberto are gay and how the story is an allegory for coming out, and it‚Äôs something so many people can connect with. Tiktok has definitely amplified its popularity through making ship videos, theories or fan edits. Whether you ship them or not or see it as a coming out story, these two characters have such a great dynamic that many people love and the story has a lot of heart and doesn‚Äôt try to be anything too deep.

56,Pixar,his grave is trashed,1629048566
57,Pixar,I always thought Miguel proved it to his family with the lyrics sent to mama coco and that was used as the proof.,1629048499
58,Pixar,"do they know? I don't think anyone mentions it after Miguel is back, I would guess they just don't know, or maybe mam√° Coco could have mentioned her dad one day just disappeared and people could assume that is because Ernesto killed him for his songs",1629046690
59,Pixar,I think it‚Äôs implied that the dead can leave messages for families‚Ä¶ that was my assumption was that everyone who was at the big party who was dead went and told their living relatives somehow. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1629046507
60,Pixar,"The UP, Monsters Inc, and Luca were all from Best Buy. Got the Wall-E one on eBay.",1629043496
61,Pixar,Love it! Where did you get the steelbooks from?,1629041879
62,Pixar,"Wall E would stuff you in his box, maybe similar to how Kirby inhales his opponents. Eve definitely would use her shooting arm.",1629040180
63,Pixar,Pretty subtle Easter egg. Wonder if it has anything to do with the plot of Turning Red,1629040009
64,Pixar,"https://youtu.be/l3W-QJQjsu4

Youre remembering a real thing but it was a teaser for Wall-E rather than part of a documentary",1629039571

75,Pixar,Awesome collection,1629000228

78,Pixar,I can only remember the face AHH I cannot figure it out,1628996083
79,Pixar,"I can see this in my mind but I can‚Äôt figure it out! Dang now this is going to bug me!

Did he have like big boxy pants with thick cuffs?",1628996002
80,Pixar,this post was removed because they don't want you to know the truth,1628992181

98,Pixar,Heard from a review that Luca expressed Italia pretty accurately so glad to hear! I especially enjoyed it because of all the color and how 'real' it felt(despite sea monsters lol). One of the sweetest movies I've seen and also made my eyes a bit wet.,1628957572
99,Pixar,Basically,1628957062

18,Pixar,"I personally have the Coco, Incredibles 2, and Onward ones. Been considering getting the Luca ones but not sure yet.",1628929302
19,Pixar,Lightyear easily. Turninn Red‚Äôs teaser disappointed me and the only reason I‚Äôm still hyped is that this is the first film by Bao‚Äôs (my favorite Pixar short) director.,1628928946
20,Pixar,At this point Disney and Pixar have similar levels of quality so Encanto is the closest we‚Äôll get to a Lin Pixar film.,1628928867
21,Pixar,I would love a Toy Story: Origins based on [this](https://youtu.be/bbmzuoBC1Rs) idea.,1628928791
22,Pixar,"Not really. Pixar is a very in-house studio and nearly every time they bring in a outside directory, it ends in disaster (Brave for example was directed by the co-director of The Prince of Egypt). I honestly think a better fit would be Sony as there styles match each other and outside directors work marvels at Sony.",1628928716
23,Pixar,Yeah it‚Äôs going to be Soul/TS4 levels of emotions while Turning Red will be Luca levels of emotions.,1628928594
24,Pixar,It would be just as hard as animating a new movie. That being said Pixar now make 3 movies every other year so they could easily give one slot to a remastered film which would allow them to devote a huge budget and animation team.,1628928483
25,Pixar,I‚Äôm glad some people liked it. For me personally it‚Äôs my least favorite Pixar films cause it‚Äôs the only one I felt bored in (also the only one I haven‚Äôt watched twice so maybe a rewatch would improve the film).,1628928382
26,Pixar,I loved watching that show aha,1628928329
27,Pixar,"Cars 2 is traumatizing for kids compared to the 2 others movies. Death by cube at the beginning, Torture of the American spy, and it continues all along the movie with the different cars that ¬´¬†died¬†¬ª with the allinol fuel‚Ä¶ it raises a lot of questions here and the scenario is really hard to get for kids. But from an adult POV, it was great.",1628927188
28,Pixar,I agree about the environment. It definitely had a character of it's own and the detail was so hyper realistic in some shots. It was like looking at a real photo,1628923216
29,Pixar,"I agree with you and I really appreciate this movie. In my opinion Good Dinosaur is a very intimate movie and I love the self discovery journey of Arlo. I feel him a lot, his struggle during the movie is so real and genuine. My favourite ""character"" is the environment. I know it could sounds weird but I love the way the environment changes, evolves and expresses his own feelings and in a strange, amazing way reflects Arlo feeling too. Arlo's habitat seems alive and It is so emotional.",1628918040
30,Pixar,"The character designs were originally made by Peargor! :

31,Pixar,Both! One of my close friends is half Thai and the mom in Turning Red reminds me a lot of his mom. I also like the idea of learning the origins of Buzz Lightyear and think another Pixar space movie will be a lot of fun.,1628912153
32,Pixar,That looks like Omni Man,1628909991
33,Pixar,"You are right, he is an amazing character!",1628878544

48,Pixar,I think the grumpy faces make it good,1628872489

54,Pixar,"He also didn't know that Linguini was his son until Remy found the papers, when he literally says (approximately from memory), ""I am a figment of your imagination. If you did not know how could I?"" Maybe the rules are a bit foggy,  or maybe he did see the sign in his peripheral; but it is clearly stated that Guestau is just in Remy's head.",1628852654

69,Pixar,I love this!!,1628815049
70,Pixar,I‚Äôve always wondered the same. I‚Äôd love to see a remaster of toy story 1 in today‚Äôs animation. It would look phenomenal when compared to the original,1628813845
71,Pixar,"Definitely. Soul and Onward were both really good, I especially liked Onward, but Luca is on another tier for me",1628810904
72,Pixar,But they sold the Vespa! Unless they bought/built another. :),1628809475

75,Pixar,"Was gonna say that, and I knew about the Easter egg since 2017",1628807022
76,Pixar,"Well Disney seems to be hopeful for movies to go back to being theatre exclusives, hence their push to not have them go to premier access.

But with the delta variant Shang Chi just might be the only movie to be theatre exclusive.  So in terms of Turning Red we‚Äôll have to wait and see the state of the world come the month of March.",1628803496

97,Pixar,"Yah, I wasn't exactly thrilled about that one, its not even related to the films in a way. Just a weird origin film about how Buzz toys came to be from it looks like.

Woody's past would be focoused on Woody and Andy's dad if it ever did happen. I assume it would end with Andy's dad giving Andy Woody before whatever happened to him.",1628781746

4,Pixar,Yes,1628779118

14,Pixar,[removed],1628752738
15,Pixar,"I can totally see that. For me, it was about the journey and self discovery Arlo went through as he came to terms with his fears and reconnected spiritually with his father. Dad was a hard ass but you could also tell he just wanted to help Arlo succeed and just didn't know how.",1628749323
16,Pixar,"Totoro is in Toy Story 3 because Miyazaki and John Lasseter have been friends for years. 

From the Wikipedia article on John Lasseter: ‚ÄúLasseter is a close friend and admirer of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, whom he first met when TMS Entertainment sent a delegation of animators to the Disney studio in 1981 and showed a clip from Miyazaki's first feature film, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979).[40] Lasseter was so deeply moved that in 1985 he insisted on showing that clip and other examples of Miyazaki's work after dinner to a woman he had just met (who would become his wife).[40] He visited Miyazaki during his first trip to Japan in 1987 and saw drawings for My Neighbor Totoro (1988).[40] After Lasseter became a successful director and producer at Pixar, he went on to serve as executive producer on several of Miyazaki's films for their release in the United States and oversaw the translation and dubbing of their English language soundtracks.[40] The gentle forest spirit Totoro from My Neighbor Totoro makes an appearance as a plush toy in Toy Story 3 (2010).‚Äù",1628749214
17,Pixar,"Yes, thank you! There is a much simpler reason why the film's have Easter eggs. We animators are a big bunch of nerds. That's literally it! Throwing in references to other things is just fun!",1628747256
18,Pixar,"The biggest problem for me was that the stakes weren‚Äôt all that interesting. I don‚Äôt mean to say the stakes have to be huge. Small stakes, like just getting home, are fine if they‚Äôre interesting. But I just didn‚Äôt really care about Arlo‚Äôs family enough to care if he made it back to them. His siblings were awful and his mom was such a nothing character. And the dead dad I didn‚Äôt really care about because he seemed abusive and controlling.",1628746652
19,Pixar,"Yes. In the 2nd film, we get hints of Woody's past yet we never see them as a flashback on screen.",1628746002
20,Pixar,Grazie! :D,1628745698
21,Pixar,"I'd accept another Toy Story movie, only if Woody returned, other than that forget about it. I always considered Woody the main character of that Franshise, he was also my favorite character. 

I'd like a sequel to Monsters Inc, we only had a pre sequal. Monsters Inc tv series focouses on other characters so...",1628745268
22,Pixar,"It changed my view on A Bugs Life, now that you bring up that one. It was a good movie but ones like The Incredibles and Toy Story 3 left more of an ever lasting impression on me. Doesn't help outdated the CGI looks.",1628745067
23,Pixar,"I haven't seen some of the later Pixar films, is it still ok for me to post my list?",1628744767
24,Pixar,I hope Lightyear is cool but I have a feeling it won‚Äôt be critically acclaimed like most other Pixar movies. Turning Red seems ok so far but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a masterpiece.,1628743960
25,Pixar,Interesting how that and the colour of the girl's bra at the end are the only things they changed pretty much,1628743816
26,Pixar,"Literally half the pixar theory makes no sense... Rather than each movie fitting into the theory, they change the theory to fit each movie. Which shows to me that it's basically just grasping at straws to connect movies; yes they all have easter eggs, but easter eggs and canonical connection are kinda different",1628743255
27,Pixar,It wasn‚Äôt my favorite but I never thought it deserved the hate it got and still gets. My friend I saw it with hated it. My kid loves it.,1628743253
28,Pixar,"No I get it. I just want one XD

The following summer, how their identities fit/don‚Äôt fit into the larger world, Alberto‚Äôs dad(lots of drama to unpack there), a few things they could play with.",1628742778
29,Pixar,"The problem is, while it deserves a sequel/series I'm not sure if it should have one... I mean, the movie was extremely good on its own, and it had a pretty satisfying conclusion. Where would they go from here? I'm scared that a sequel or TV series would just make it convoluted, similar to what happened to Olaf from Frozen if that makes sense? Like it just becomes a watered-down marketable kids thing rather than an emotional masterpiece.  
(That said, Olaf isn't the best example since he was never anything else... Idk how to explain it though hhh)",1628742415
30,Pixar,Same frfr other than like A Bugs Life and maybe some of the super unknown ones they have no genuinely bad movies. Also have you ever seen the Pixar shorts...?!?!!!! They all deserve proper releases they're so beautiful,1628742218
31,Pixar,"And Luca, how could you forget Luca D:&lt; it was beautiful and amazing",1628742075
32,Pixar,They‚Äôre moving in that direction already. Luca‚Äôs director said that he definitely was inspired by Ghibli and you can see that from the pacing and setting of the movie.,1628740728
33,Pixar,"I definitely agree with you. I love Coco, I love Onward, and I love Luca.

A few of the masterpieces that everyone loves I don‚Äôt hold in high esteem. I liked Brave, Wall-E, and Ratatouille, but they aren‚Äôt the ones I reach for when I feel the need to watch a Pixar movie.

Movies like Monsters Inc, A Bugs Life, and yes, even Cars, just holds a high amount of nostalgia for me. 

As an adult, I relish every single new Pixar movie that is released. This is a controversial opinion but I believe that Pixar hasn‚Äôt made a bad movie. I know that there are weaker movies like The Good Dinosaur and Cars 2. But I haven‚Äôt seen a Pixar movie and thought, ‚ÄúWell that was a waste of my time.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúThat movie sucked, didn‚Äôt it.‚Äù I get something new out of each and every Pixar movie. That‚Äôs why this studio is so special to me.",1628740562
34,Pixar,Very low chances but it could happen and it sounds interesting.,1628739728
35,Pixar,I believe this image is from a [message board Pixar sent to Miyazaki!](https://i.redd.it/dlv2t26tmsf61.jpg),1628739335
36,Pixar,It's my favorite movie! I've watched ot about 6 or 7 times since it came out! I just wish I could have enjoyed it in theaters too.,1628733623

39,Pixar,I‚Äôm good with either.,1628733263
40,Pixar,Wasn't he in Toy story 3?,1628733132
41,Pixar,Thank you very much. I agree with you on that and I love the idea that when he's alone he's not as confident as he pretends to be. Because there's little about him he's my favourite character to analysis and I relate to his backstory so I like putting my own angst into it.,1628732817
42,Pixar,I believe they did the dub for spirited away? Or helped in some regard. I could be wrong. I read somewhere that the hopping lamp character was a nod to Pixar.,1628732817
43,Pixar,"Thank you very much and I do agree, i've never seen a Pixar movie garner such a fandom in such a short time and I guess i'm apart of it. I just love this movie &lt;3",1628732625
44,Pixar,"Thank you, fun fact the ripped drawing was a last minute change. I was originally going to use the lighting by having the darker parts over the dad, symbolism ya know? Then I read this blog about how the vespa drawing represents Alberto's heart and then I thought he'd more likely rip the drawing which looks better and made it a whole lot easier to draw :D",1628732530
45,Pixar,"No, That's Disney themselves",1628732140
46,Pixar,Would you want the prequel to be a movie or a show? Like the new monsters inc show,1628731725
47,Pixar,Thinking back on it there really were a lot of cars 2 toys,1628731362
48,Pixar,I gotta agree I kinda don‚Äôt like the way his story ended but also. Your childhood hero letting you down isn‚Äôt a excuse to commit genocide. Denounce all hero‚Äôs and stop believing in them ?maybe but commit genocide against all hero‚Äôs including ones that never wronged you ? No.,1628730798
49,Pixar,"i‚Äôm not a lover nor a hater, my review was: mehü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

probably won‚Äôt watch it again until i have another pixar marathon, but it wasn‚Äôt bad.",1628730765
50,Pixar,Yes! I really enjoy the Good Dino. It‚Äôs a little predictable but it still such a good movie that I‚Äôve watched a few times.,1628730601
51,Pixar,"There‚Äôs nothing stopping Totoro from being in the same universe as Monsters, this could be fun. Maybe Randall gets lost in the woods and befriends him and learns to mellow out or something",1628730404
52,Pixar,Incredibles 3. No questions,1628729809
53,Pixar,A Ghibli Pixar collab would be awesome,1628728146
54,Pixar,It‚Äôs a pretty short movie (only 95 minutes). Most Pixar movies are longer than 95 minutes. 3-year-olds usually have trouble sitting through long movies.,1628726631

57,Pixar,Doesn't Pixar do the English dubs for Ghibli?,1628718001
58,Pixar,"I appreciate Luca for its simplicity and tone. While Up and Soul are much better films, I find their re-watchability falls because they are very meaningful movies. When I want to watch a movie, I don‚Äôt necessarily want to have to ponder too deeply about it. Luca is a film I can rewatch again because it is a fun adventure that isn‚Äôt too serious.

Also, the score is fabulously done. ‚ÄúTelescope‚Äù is my favorite track from the soundtrack and it has such great energy to it.",1628717266
59,Pixar,Bellissimo! I learned that word from Luca,1628716249
60,Pixar,"Only one I got wrong was the question not about a Pixar movie, and only because I saw one answer was actually a Pixar movie so I just clicked that without fully reading the question",1628715975

It checks every box.",1628710826

67,Pixar,"Literally my daughters favorite movie. I have watched it at least 35 times. She doesn‚Äôt watch any other Pixar movie nearly as much as Luca. So I think the movie is awesome, if my 3year old likes to sit through it, then they must have done something right.",1628707519

21,Pixar,"Look, this is probably my favourite Pixar movie and I'd love a sequel... But what would they actually do with it??

But also cars is the movie I GREW UP with, from pre school up until now when I keep watching it every so often, and it's the reason I am such a car guy. Sure objectively it might not be Pixar's best, but i still love it",1628497281
14,Pixar,Who looks kinda like Alberto!,1628496045
15,Pixar,That‚Äôs exactly what I said when I saw it üòÇ my husband said the same thing!,1628496031
16,Pixar,"Yeah the animation is insanely good. The stitches on No and Woody is insane and it's all so good. I also feel like with the whole series being about Woody's story, it made sense that now it was his time to move on and put himself first after years of putting everyone else before himself",1628492870
17,Pixar,Toy story 3 is a masterpiece,1628492587
18,Pixar,Its even got a Shepard boy,1628492391
19,Pixar,"Yeah, but if Bob was a little more considerate, he could have had him become a gadget designer (not even necessarily for him) and they could have developed his technology by testing it on supers in a contained lab without killing them, thus advancing society forward in unbelievable ways... something similar to that ""how it should have ended"" video. Like the guy comes up to you with jet boots and you're not even mildly impressed? ""Yeah, piss off, you clearly mad genius"" real smooth there, Bob.",1628486019
20,Pixar,That‚Äôs so Alberto‚Äôs tower!,1628484475
21,Pixar,"Yeah I think it was good. I didn‚Äôt grow up with 3 and I never thought it was the best Toy Story. I personally think 4 had the best ending and the story was good, and the CGI was AMAZING.",1628482960
22,Pixar,"That's cool. My favorites are 1,2,4,3. I like the third one, but it's kind of hard to watch because of how sad it is and how it makes me feel as far as missing when I was a kid and being reminded that the joy and simpleness of childhood is over",1628480847
23,Pixar,disney might drop it in theatres and d+ as a market experiment,1628480659
24,Pixar,"Not OP, but 4 is my favorite of the series",1628480644
25,Pixar,"Walle, Onward, Up, Cars, Monsters Inc to round out my top 5",1628480618
26,Pixar,"Cars is in my top 5, Cars 2 is at the bottom though",1628480579
27,Pixar,Nice üòÇ,1628479722
28,Pixar,Having a beef with Bob Parr doesn't justify becoming a murderer. Most people don't deal with a single bad emotional experience by becoming a serial killer.,1628479644
29,Pixar,"What theater are you at?
I went to see space Jam a New Legacy and that was the first trailer I saw, I went to AMC",1628478931
30,Pixar,"Mine too, Toy Story 3 to be exact :)",1628478318
31,Pixar,Monster‚Äôs Inc!,1628476779
32,Pixar,"Do you like Toy Story 4? I actually like it a lot, but a lot of people don't like it.",1628474984
33,Pixar,Cars is my #2!,1628474749
34,Pixar,"Finding Nemo, as far as Pixar goes!",1628474734
35,Pixar,I can‚Äôt choose,1628474025
36,Pixar,"Coco, the only movie that makes me cry like a baby EVERYTIME!",1628471829
37,Pixar,pixar said it would be in theaters when it was announced,1628470830
38,Pixar,Ah man seeing Luca in theaters would have been amazing,1628470664
39,Pixar,The Incredibles just does everything right and it has infinite replayability.,1628470551
40,Pixar,"Mr. Incredible did not ""make him"" turn evil. Could he have been nicer to him? Sure. But literally he was keeping him safe. It would not have been safe for him to go fight crime with a superhero. He was a kid. With no powers to protect himself. 

And why should anyone get a reward for killing a bunch of people and attacking a city just to make themselves look good?",1628469232
41,Pixar,Lightning,1628469077
42,Pixar,What about Destruction Plants? Or SpongeBob?,1628468911
43,Pixar,"I can‚Äôt choose between Inside Out, Coco and Toy Story 2 (all of them are amazing but 2 is my favorite)",1628467981
44,Pixar,"And it's implied he's been building cutting edge weapons for despots and/or criminals, on top of wiping out a lot of super heroes.",1628467881
45,Pixar,[deleted],1628466846
46,Pixar,I never had a favorite Pixar movie. I always loved all the movies. But a few weeks ago I watched Luca and for me it is the best Pixar movie by far. This movie touched me in a way no other movie have ever done before. Luca is simple and beautiful.,1628465846
47,Pixar,"In my theater, Luca was on a ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù poster after it was announced as direct to Disney+. If Turning Red were released today it would be just like Luca and Soul, but since March is still a while away and we have time to get people vaccinated I think it has a good chance of being in theaters.",1628465624
48,Pixar,Ratatouille first WALL-E in second,1628464747
49,Pixar,And what‚Äôs syndromes reward for ~~standing up for himself~~ committing genocide?,1628464376
50,Pixar,"According to the director on Twitter, they go by the name Sea Folk",1628464007
51,Pixar,"Yeah man I‚Äôve always hated this. Syndrome was an innocent fan and Mr. Incredible is a total asshole for treating him like shit and making him turn evil. And what‚Äôs syndromes reward for standing up for himself? Death. Not just a simple death either, but being cut up into pieces. The story of a kid with aspiring dreams to be a superhero who ends up being the villain and getting killed as a result of negligence‚Ä¶??",1628462088
52,Pixar,Pretty sure! ü§£,1628459210
53,Pixar,"Luca, then brave and Coco",1628459202
54,Pixar,WALL-E,1628458817
55,Pixar,Mostly by the adult fans sadly,1628458281
56,Pixar,Toy story,1628457764
57,Pixar,It‚Äôs Coming Out Until Next Year 2022?,1628457408
58,Pixar,Coco.,1628457335
59,Pixar,"I don't live close enough to a large cinema chain to visit one regularly, so I miss seeing these types of posters.",1628456680
60,Pixar,"The next few marvel movies are gonna be theatre exclusively, supposedly if we don‚Äôt have another lockdown.

I imagine Turning Red will have the same treatment.",1628456385
61,Pixar,Yea,1628456085
62,Pixar,"Ratatouille, no contest.",1628455844
63,Pixar,It‚Äôs in the National Gallery of Art in DC and is called ‚ÄúItalian Coast Scene with Ruined Tower‚Äù by Thomas Cole,1628455794
64,Pixar,"Coco

First movie I watched after a looong period of not having watched any Pixar, didn't expect nothing, cried at the end, wonderful movie, made me rewatch all of Pixar again xD",1628455659
65,Pixar,He is true beauty and perfection. I love him,1628455553
66,Pixar,"Coco, hands down. Followed by Luca",1628455416
67,Pixar,Cars. But it‚Äôs one of the most hated Pixar films sadly.,1628455131
68,Pixar,[deleted],1628454963
69,Pixar,Ratatouille,1628454641
70,Pixar,Toy Story 1,1628454363
71,Pixar,I think it also happens in Monsters at Work,1628452054
72,Pixar,Inside Out,1628450419
73,Pixar,WALL-E,1628449863
74,Pixar,The Incredible for me! üòÅ,1628449330
75,Pixar,Monsters inc 4 life,1628449221
76,Pixar,Finn Mcmissile is too cool for this movie to be bad.,1628448556
77,Pixar,When I saw that I thought the same thing,1628448459
78,Pixar,"Finding Nemo. What a masterpiece, really. Interesting, funny characters, amazing plot and just overall, a great vibe.",1628447270
79,Pixar,The Incredibles with Ratatouille as a close second,1628446720
80,Pixar,"Ratatouille is definitely mine, Soul is a close second though",1628446644
81,Pixar,WALL-E,1628446491
82,Pixar,Cars 1 has to be my favorite but imo cars 3 is so emotional and that‚Äôs what makes it elite level as well. It‚Äôs just so relatable to anyone who has ever played sports and tugs at the heart strings,1628444984
83,Pixar,"Coco.   From every single angle, that film is a masterpiece.",1628444210
84,Pixar,"Well it better be! Cause if it ain't, then imma be lowkey devastated.",1628443978
85,Pixar,"Toy Story. Bug‚Äôs Life. Inside Out.

Tough choice but used to watch the first two a lot when I was a kid. They‚Äôll always hold a special place for me.",1628443790
86,Pixar,Toy Story,1628443688
87,Pixar,Ok Kakyoin,1628442692
88,Pixar,NO SHIT,1628442663
89,Pixar,Googly bear....,1628440182
90,Pixar,"Cars 1 was already lower-tier Pixar and Cars 2 is a tier or two below that. It‚Äôs not even a Cars movies. It‚Äôs a 105 minute episode of Maters Tall Tales. I actually think Cars 3 is the best of the Cars trilogy, but even that is only mid-tier at best.",1628439203
91,Pixar,"I hope Buzz thinks he is a toy in Lightyear

But for real, they better get Tim Allen to voice someone in the movie. Even if it‚Äôs just a one line cameo.",1628438739
92,Pixar,Yeah I‚Äôm,1628437206
93,Pixar,"Would love a sequel, I just wanna see Wall-e and EVE in a movie together or a Pixar popcorn at least, since it‚Äôs been 13 years",1628437115
94,Pixar,Definitely,1628437008
95,Pixar,"Really liked it as a movie, but as a Pixar movie, very ehhhhhhh",1628436947
96,Pixar,definitely üòÇüòÇüòÇ,1628434177
97,Pixar,‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôm on a streaming service!‚Äù,1628429186
98,Pixar,A callback to the end of that Monsters Inc commercial where the M is in Mike's way,1628428761
99,Pixar,"Well, the actor who plays Buzz, Lightyears more an in-universe movie then real life. They're totally going to cast Tim Allen in some sort of cameo, though.",1628425730
0,Pixar,"Thank you for the offer, it's really kind, but I actually contacted the Nordic countries' distributor of Chronicle Books and she answered that the book may will come to Finland for a few weeks. Here are btw the contacts of the international distributors if anyone's interested: [https://www.chroniclebooks.com/pages/international-accounts](https://www.chroniclebooks.com/pages/international-accounts)",1628418579
1,Pixar,I think the way the end credits are blocking Mike‚Äôs face,1628416850
2,Pixar,?,1628410732
3,Pixar,"The only pixar movie that was created for selling toys and not to tell a story,the worse one by far.
It's embarrassing for the best studio I know to have such an abomination of a movie",1628405492
4,Pixar,Ahh ok nice catch,1628405080
5,Pixar,It's the same bike seen besides the boat they use to get to the surface so a fisherman don't see them when entering Portorosso,1628404964
6,Pixar,Luca painted the flames in honor of Alberto's Vespa drawing qith flames,1628404840
7,Pixar,"3 is by far my favorite. Everything about it is good, from the cast and characters to the animation (absolutely wonderful how far Pixar animation has come) to the story, to just simply the racing scenes.

The racing scenes in the first and third movie just give me such good vibes, but that might just be because I love to watch both IRL racing and animation (especially Pixar). The combination of the camera angles, car sounds, soundtrack (for the opening races in particular) and just the racing in general just bring a smile upon my face every time I watch it.",1628403906
8,Pixar,Pretty sure it is intentional,1628400753
9,Pixar,OMG üòÇ,1628399901
10,Pixar,Honestly I only liked the first one. Other two went wayyyy too unnecessarily far with their stories. There was no need for them.,1628393705
11,Pixar,"Originally I hated it, but I rewatched it a couple weeks ago and kind of enjoyed it. It's nowhere near the best pixar movie, probably one of the worst, but it's a fun movie and so ridiculous it's enjoyable",1628393398
12,Pixar,I was entertained when I watched it. It‚Äôs not a bad movie. But it really is a weak show compared to the rest IMO and not one I rewatch. Perhaps one day on a Pixar marathon.,1628393268
13,Pixar,I think it‚Äôs just cos that‚Äôs all he has. I do wonder where he got the second bike from though,1628393193
14,Pixar,"It was okay, but I felt like Cars 3 is what I wanted from the first Cars sequel, especially since Cars is my second favorite Pixar.",1628393109
15,Pixar,Nice! Where are the figures from? They look much better than the mattell ones?,1628392986
16,Pixar,"Since it's about the human the toy is based on, not the toy itself.",1628392635
17,Pixar,[removed],1628387901
18,Pixar,I think the director said that they just liked the idea of using the colander as a helmet as he uses one as a helmet twice. They also added flames to it because it wasn't cool enough.,1628387073
19,Pixar,"Yup.  From what I gather, Hanks‚Äô brother voices Woody when Tom is unavailable and/or just doesn‚Äôt feel like it.",1628384247
20,Pixar,"Wow, where did you see Hank?",1628383985

25,Pixar,Woah these are awesome!,1628373766
26,Pixar,"Cars two was so unnecessary to the franchise and is definitely the worst out of the three. Cars, in general, is such a high quality franchise and I expected a lot after the first one was so good. That being said, I still think it‚Äôs a good movie. Just not the level of cars 1 or 3",1628373582
27,Pixar,"8 feet is 2,44 metres. According to Ocean Portal the average male is 11-13 feet or 3-4 metres. But I don't know, he seems very big in the movie though. I like Bruce; he's a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine.

29,Pixar,I really love it!!!! I have also made some themed boxes of the coco and luca movies that have been quite beautiful in my opinion ...,1628370026
30,Pixar,"Yoo these figures are super cool, where'd you get them?",1628366469
31,Pixar,I hope that in Lightyear Buzz is shown to have a brother who is voiced by Tim Allen. This would be a pretty clever reference to the fact that Woody‚Äôs real life toys are voiced by Tom Hanks‚Äô brother.,1628364036
32,Pixar,Whoops sorry my bad,1628361072
33,Pixar,why don't they use tim allen as the voice actor?,1628360836

59,Pixar,I'd prefere a sequel to Monsters inc and see the grown up Boo :'),1628302396

73,Pixar,Nope I think they work better either on their own or with Sony. Pixar and Disney come with a lot of restraints and oversight and I don't think their style would mesh well with that studio. I think it's great Disney and Pixar have been getting competition from them! Goodness knows they need it to not get too complacent,1628283430
74,Pixar,"Yes it would work but with a lot of creative restraint from Pixar‚Äôs Disney overseers. I think their partners with Sony though, because Sony says who cares what they do just let them do it!",1628282967
75,Pixar,No I think,1628282790
76,Pixar,nope. just common bits and pieces spread throughout modern cartoony art that just look similar.,1628281356
77,Pixar,They should direct whatever they want to direct,1628279727

79,Pixar,"I just watched their latest The Mitchells vs The Machines the other day and it was fantastic as well. It would be cool to see them take on a Pixar film but in a way I almost prefer them to stick with Sony animation to keep the quality of competition up. The more strong competitors Pixar has, the better it is for us as fans. But of course they would do great if they did so I'm certainly not opposed",1628278884

83,Pixar,Luca‚Äôs look is influenced by classic claymation like Wallace and Gromit,1628278074

Although not alot of classic cartoons used bean shaped smiles.

Fletcher cartoons, like Superman or Popeye, used a more realistic look.",1628277953

86,Pixar,When I saw it I noticed they have bean shaped smiles just like Steven Universe had.,1628277711
87,Pixar,"Steven Universe has subtle style influence from the classic cartoons from the 30‚Äôs/40‚Äôs (see also Cuphead and Charlie Brown) with the eyes and mouths, so I doubt it. Probably they both just shared a similar style influence.",1628277596
88,Pixar,"I mean it's definitely a stretch at this point, but it's still fun to think about",1628277102

3,Pixar,"Wall-E doesn't need a sequel, just like star wars didn't it. Making a sequel would ruin the whole story. There is nothing else to say, what happens next is shown in the end credits. Tho a PREQUEL would be something interesting in a certain way",1628259482
4,Pixar,"Ok, i dont know why no one is talking about this but, in the official luca trailer at 54 sec, Ercole says, ""woah woah wait, did you see that?"" even though its not in the movie. i wanna know what happened to it and what the scene was originally going to be. can someone please answer my question, it doesnt make sense.",1628257924
5,Pixar,His expression is so on point. Good job!,1628255196
6,Pixar,I don't think a movie would be good maybe a TV series  it would probably be about finding the other humans on the other ships and about how society has developed but I still think it would be missing the charm of the live story in the first one since eve was the driving force for wall.E and all his actions err ok,1628254752

11,Pixar,"The Toy Story movies for sure are the best sequels, not only in Pixar but I‚Äôd argue in the film industry. They‚Äôre the only movies to expand the existing universe, further develop the characters and never feel like a total cash grab (Toy Story 4 is on the ropes for that last one though). Aside from that I don‚Äôt think any other Pixar movies are that good. 

I thought the Incredibles 2 was alright, I loved all the family stuff but I could never get attached to Elastigirls story or the villains. 
I didn‚Äôt like Finding Dory, I was never a big fan of her character so naturally I didn‚Äôt really warm to an entire movie dedicated to her. 
I pretty much despite Cars 2 because it‚Äôs Cars 2 and Cars 3 was much better but I still wouldn‚Äôt call it good. 
Monsters University is in a grey area for me since I watched it when I was young and associate a lot of nostalgia with it but I don‚Äôt think it was a great movie.",1628233336

36,Pixar,There is an explanation given in the Pixar Theory that I think makes sense. The theory says that our WALL-E was the only one left because of his fascination to humans.,1628200815
37,Pixar,Dude just said the exact same thing only to realize that this comment was here and took the words right out of my mouth,1628200706

39,Pixar,"The film is about shedding light on how we mistreat the planet, showing us a possible future of humanity.

49,Pixar,"I don‚Äôt think a sequel to WALL-E is necessary at all. Aside from Pixar being pretty terrible are producing well developed sequels, the ending to Wall-e is one of my favourite parts.

They land back on Earth, he remembers Eve and it ends with them planting that little seed. I love it‚Äôs positive message, and now more than ever is it relevant. It has faith that humanity will try and fix the environment, and whilst it may not be realistic, it has such a strong and empowering message that any sequel would ruin it.",1628192748

B) it has a tragic ending",1628184856

55,Pixar,"Yeah but like, we already saw it in the end credits? What would be the point of seeing it extended over feature length, other than getting to see the characters again? We know what happens, and there's little you can do, character arc-wise. The humans have found their motivation again, the robots have gained free will, WALL-E and EVE are in love. There's no seed there for taking the characters further, it'd just be us seeing them live life.

Which, if you want more WALL-E content, I think a series of shorts would make more sense.

Like you *want* a sequel, but the story doesn't really need continuing. The best stories leave you wanting more, letting the audience's imagination fill in the blanks.",1628182309

89,Pixar,Yeah I enjoyed the originals it would be nice to see sequels for movies that were very successful.,1628100758
90,Pixar,Oh c'mon. Don't you like originals? Originals are the foundations for sequels!! Pixar isn't Disney. They don't make sequels for the sake of sequels e.g like 8 aladdins. They make a fantastic story and then make a sequel. If someone thinks of an outstanding story then sure why not but if not then no sequel sorry. If you don't like originals then fine but let them make a few and then maybe they'll make a sequel for one of them. But no I get it you want a sequel for one of the classics. But c'mon it's been 23 years since A Bug's Life came out. The max they've done is 14 years for an Incredibles. If you want a sequel to a classic then maybe Incredibles 3. Or the upcoming Cars series as a sequel series?? Many dont like cars but do you? Look Pixar might but it's unlikely. Just enjoy the originals whilst they last. They might have a strong of sequels once they build up enough originals. And hey Lightyear is at least a spinoff right?,1628097315

83,Pixar,Well done üíô especially the little fish in O,1627860845
84,Pixar,"I also totally agree. I really, truly, and genuinely don't understand the hate for this movie. Every criticism I've seen is about either the chaos behind the making of it or comparing it to the first movie and pointing out how different the two are. I've yet to see a single piece of criticism that's examined the movie itself, stripped of context, and judged it based on its own merits. And that's a huge shame, cause it is a fun movie with an interesting new spin direction in building the Cars universe. It certainly doesn't deserve the abysmal 30-something percent it's gotten on Rotten Tomatoes. For context... that's what Shark's Tale has. And those two movies are on completely different planes of existence as far as competency goes. 

The biggest complaint seems to be that it took a completely different tone and creative direction from the first movie, but like... so what? That's not automatically a bad thing, yet that's the way it's treated. There have been some *great* sequels that were complete revamps from their original movies. Mad Max, anyone? ""It's bad because it's different"" isn't a valid criticism unless one goes into why the differences make it bad. In which case, just stick to those points. There's no need to incessantly compare it to the first one. The first one was a fantastic movie, and it stands alone. Cars 2 is *obviously* designed to be a completely different kind of movie, so it makes no sense to compare it to its predecessor. 

I enjoyed it. I'm a big Bond fan, so I appreciated the references, both subtle and not so subtle. The soundtrack is the best in the franchise, and it's got really fun, interesting action, set-pieces, and aesthetic. The theme is a little weak, but the new characters are solid, the plot is interesting, and the movie still has heart. It's a fun, fish-out-of-water spy thriller that I was pleasantly surprised by when I recently watched it for the first time with my kid (he decided Cars was his favorite movie and wanted to see more). I'd missed it on its initial release, cause people said it was so bad. Now I regret trusting what people said. I enjoyed this a heck of a lot more than I liked Toy Story 4.",1627853590

91,Pixar,"No organization is, at heart, ever a 'trusted' one. People have misgivings about them for some reason or another, either by rumor or facts/numbers, and the C.D.A. are no different. As we see, Roz had been undercover at Monsters Inc. for two years...a rather long cover that had her as the...I believe dispatcher for Scare Floor F. So it's safe to say, if this pratice was known, some people would be scared or worried about 'slipping up' in ANY guidelines because 'that monster there might be with the C.D.A.'....fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, etc....Disney owns that now heh heh.

But, to be fair, this WAS a reason the two could have taken. And not even THAT far. Sullivan could have just told Randall about the escaped kid. For all he knew, Randall was working late at night for overtime (perfectly acceptable reason). BUT...perhaps he was worried about what Randall's reaction would be. They weren't on exactly good terms, so maybe if he said something, Randall would push the alarm and Sullivan would end up shaved bald like poor old George. 
Of course, Randall wouldn't have done that given the...sensitivity of what he was really doing, so he probably would have just returned the kid to the door and try to convince Sullivan he won't tell if he just left, like it never happened. As much as he disliked the blue behemoth, there were more things at stake. And he couldn't have been 'blamed' for anything, especially at the time, since what he appeared to be doing was perfectly fine to do after hours.

As for harming Boo...WELL....they blew up a sock. Yes, they blew up that sock from George. And if it was just something a human child TOUCHED, imagine what they would do to a full HUMAN...!
....BUT...thats a fear for if they cared about a human, which lets face it, most monsters just considered dangerous, but necessary, energy sources. Which, both Sullivan and Wazowski did as well initially.

The concern was for themselves, and partly explained by Wazowski. SURE, it could have all been fixed at the start, but for some reason Sullivan brought Boo out of the factory and went to Wazowski, of all people, for advice. A little...dependant on friendship there eh? As Wazowski explains, they could be BANISHED for being involved with a human kid in the monster world, one of, if not worst, punishment in their legal system. Not to mention that kids are TOXIC, and can cause monsters, apparently, to MELT.
What was Sullivan thinking? Well...he wasn't, not really. He may be a normal monster who tries to work hard, and he may have moments of insight, but he's not exactly the brightest bulb. I mean, he went to WAZOWSKI for advice on what to do...

Essentially it boils down to Sullivan being unable to handle the situation presented to him, unwilling to ask Randall for help (which was it's own landmine of things), went to a person he THOUGHT could fix things...and then the two being stuck managing the situation because of the possible punishments they would have.

Though...to be fair...Boo DID touch Sullivan from the start, so as far as he knew, he was already contaiminated. The CDA would know straight away, since they have machines to detect that apparently...and given it wasn't a sock...perhaps the worry was the fact that he could undergo something WORSE than being shaved bald?

I guess, ironically, it was fear that sped Sullivan on to make a dumb decision. And that makes him more...human?",1627561319

37,Pixar,For Slinky they recasted. They ended up reusing Potato Head‚Äôs lines from previous movies and looking through archives- IIRC the reason why they didn‚Äôt replace him is due to a request from the VA‚Äôs family to not replace him,1627508833

12,Pixar,"&gt;I don't get this thought process that it invalidates the other movies. The events in the other Toy Stories are still very important but the whole point of TS4 is to show maybe there is more to life than you originally thought.

Because the end of TS3 very clearly concludes the story with a ""Happily ever after"" with Bonnie. Woody spends the entirety of TS3 obsessing over how he needs to get back to Andy's side, and at the end, the finally accepts a new life, as we accept with Andy that you can honor your toys by passing them down. TS4 goes and says ""lol, nvm Woody hates it at Bonnie's"".

&gt;Think about this from a human standpoint, do we ever just discover the purpose of life and then keep living that life happily until we die?

Yes, several people do. Personally, I'm not exactly struggling for purpose. And the entire thematic core of the first 3 movies is about the characters returning to their central purpose of wanting to be played with, and the bond between child and toy. Every villain is an obstacle to that idea, and every movie's happy ending results in a return to it. Being a ""Lost Toy"" in TS4 is pretty much identical to the reformed Sunnyside, and Woody could have easily chosen that path in TS3, but ultimately chose to go back to Andy, because he not only wanted to be played with, but wanted the bond to a child.",1627421283

22,Pixar,I noticed when they first showed professor knight. I said wtf is this,1627405372
23,Pixar,"Idk what people are talking about. The animation and character models in Monsters At Work are actually AMAZING for a series. The characters look like themselves and Sully has real fur, not that fake fur/hair they sometimes put in lower-budget 3D shows that looks like playdough/frosting. I‚Äôm not bashing a show that has that because usually it‚Äôs because of budgeting/time, but I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt do that here. 
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt really notice a difference in the animation at all until people started nitpicking it. And I‚Äôm an animation student lol",1627403911
24,Pixar,"Well actually, I‚Äôd rather have them just make the show 2D if they think they don‚Äôt have enough budget/time to make good-looking 3D. Like the Kung Fu Panda show that used to be on Nick. I watched it all the time as a kid but there were small sections of it that were animated in 2D instead of 3D and I always thought those parts looked better lol",1627403679

26,Pixar,"I think the character models and world looks great, but the animation in the movement is a bit off sometimes. It seems a little ‚Äòjittery‚Äô, but still pretty good for a TV show. It just doesn‚Äôt compare to even the original film most of the time",1627401725

29,Pixar,"You make a lot of great points, and I totally agree that both Luca and Alberto have different motivations.  Though I think Alberto‚Äôs motivation is more nuanced, and affected by his childhood trauma of being abandoned by his father. To me it seems that Alberto is trying really hard with Luca‚Äôs relationship because he needs the validation. He craves feeling needed, and Luca‚Äôs growing friendship with Guilia is seen as another betrayal and abandonment.  

With that feeling of being needed, at the end of the movie, he does get that validation, and a new father figure in the form of Massimo. 


He ultimately finds what he is also looking for, and it just happens to be different than Luca.  That‚Äôs what I like about the ending, they became good friends, but life eventually takes them to different places. That happens a lot in real life, and really resonated with me. That was also part of the magic of this movie, taking and perfectly portraying real and meaningful relationships.",1627391834

94,Pixar,"&gt; Did you know blick/blik is an exceptionally offensive term for a black person?

no way there was a cartoon character calls Blik, it's a black cat... the cartoon name is catscratch and I took the name from it.",1627305108
95,Pixar,Best ending to a pixar movie no doubt. Makes me cry like a baby every time,1627305033
96,Pixar,Why did you feel the need to post this,1627304594
97,Pixar,"I just watched it this weekend with Monsters University (now *that* is an underrated film) and I love it more every time. It's perfectly funny, sweet, charming and gorgeous to look at. I mean, this movie came out 20 years ago, how does it still look this good?",1627304407

13,Pixar,"It‚Äôs not the best Pixar movie, it‚Äôs the best movie. This is coming from a guy who mainly watches foreign, arthouse, and indie films. I took film classes multiple times, and have learned what makes a quality piece of cinema. Monsters Inc is a masterpiece.",1627300498
14,Pixar,Wow. Did you know blick/blik is an exceptionally offensive term for a black person?,1627299858
15,Pixar,Love the logo,1627299786
16,Pixar,Mike and Sully are superior to both of those for me,1627297023
17,Pixar,What about Dory &amp; Marlin or Buzz &amp; Woody?,1627296965
18,Pixar,Finding Nemo is the best pixar movie for me. Manages to make us laugh and cry. So wholesome,1627296923
19,Pixar,I like that it is sto relatable. Most kids thought there are nonsters under their beds so Pixar made a film to show us their Pov. This movie managed to make us laugh and cry and cheer for the monsters. It has so much depth especially when Sully realises that Boo is scared of Randall. It shows him that scaring is wrong.,1627296857
20,Pixar,I would definitely give him a hug ü•∫,1627296602

22,Pixar,[deleted],1627294714
23,Pixar,Now this i'd watch,1627293785
24,Pixar,Personally loved Toy Story 4. It's not better than 3 but I would rank it above the first 2 personally.,1627292660
25,Pixar,Why though? TS4 was very well-done imho.,1627292633
26,Pixar,I honestly loved Toy Story 4 way more than Monsters University. Don't get the hate for TS4,1627292613
27,Pixar,Dgo,1627292399
28,Pixar,Monsters at Work is good when it's just focusing on Mike and Sully and not MIFT,1627291779
29,Pixar,[removed],1627291024
30,Pixar,It's definitely up there. My favorites are Wall-E and Cars (it's really nostalgic for me),1627288377
31,Pixar,Hopefully they‚Äôll get the inspiration to resurrect this cancelled project somehow. The protag in particular looks really funky.,1627288343
32,Pixar,Macciadog,1627287358
33,Pixar,We can see that.,1627284202
34,Pixar,Is this really unpopular,1627277796
35,Pixar,It's my second favourite. Mike and Sully are easily the best Pixar duo and it's easily the funniest Pixar movie,1627277563
36,Pixar,Inside Out because it's just so human. Toy Story for nostalgia. Coco for the pure beauty. Monsters for the fun. I'd have to say these are my favorite Pixars. Also the Bound and Bao win the Pixar shorts for me.,1627277051
37,Pixar,üò°could‚Äôve stopped at any Pixar movie,1627276158
38,Pixar,"Ratatouille has a better story to it, but Incredibles is more fun to rewatch. I‚Äôll go with Ratatouille.",1627272922
39,Pixar,for a movie that‚Äôs about 20 years old the world building and plot was really way ahead of its time.,1627272349
40,Pixar,"Hey, we can all agree to disagree. It‚Äôs just your opinion. I personally have not watched it(dont judge plz), but I plan to since you seem to have enjoyed it so much. :)",1627272324
41,Pixar,"This isn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion at all, Monsters Inc is one of the most popular Pixar movies, now it isn‚Äôt my favorite but it‚Äôs up there, I do love it. My favorite Pixar movie of all of them is definitely the first Toy Story, I watched it all the time on Disney Channel as a kid and I still love it today.",1627271529

44,Pixar,It's my favorite.,1627270760
45,Pixar,"Definitely a masterpiece, but for all of your arguments, I would say they all apply to Finding Nemo, for me.",1627270110
46,Pixar,"It‚Äôs number 4 on my list behind The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Toy Story 2. I will say that if I had to introduce someone to Pixar though who had never seen any of their movies, Monsters Inc would be a great choice. It blends so much heart, creativity, zaniness, and comedy together perfectly and really shows what Pixar can do at their A game. It was also a genius move to have Randall as the Red Herring because that makes Waternoose one of the best Disney/Pixar twist villains.",1627269898
47,Pixar,it‚Äôs my favorite!!,1627269676
48,Pixar,I would choose any Pixar movie that‚Äôs not Cars 2.,1627269555
49,Pixar,Agree agree agree,1627269328

60,Pixar,I did?,1627260739
61,Pixar,I would choose wall-E. It's my favorite!,1627260329
62,Pixar,"so you could stay up, eh?",1627259908
63,Pixar,you might've misunderstood the ending,1627257563
64,Pixar,Agree they haven‚Äôt been updated since TS4. I‚Äôm probably would switch mine to Terry or Guilia if they were options.,1627257366
65,Pixar,"Incredibles and WALL E are top 2, Ratatouille gets 3rd place from me",1627256614
66,Pixar,Thank you!!,1627256614
67,Pixar,Really clever and creative!,1627256592
68,Pixar,we need onward ones too.,1627255493
69,Pixar,"Same here. I‚Äôve still got my VHS tapes of the first two Toy Story films, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc.",1627255092
70,Pixar,I watched Toy Story a thousand times on VCR. It will always hold a special place in my heart,1627255026
71,Pixar,"If you‚Äôve been watching monsters at work than you‚Äôve seen Mike‚Äôs Comedy Classes. I wanted to expand on that idea!

My thought process is that comedy clubs aren‚Äôt a thing in Monstropolis, so Mike had to book a nightclub and painted over the S. 

I also thought it would be totally in character for Mike to truly believe this was a teaching moment for his fellow monsters. So that‚Äôs why he called it ‚ÄúMike Wazowski‚Äôs - How to Laugh‚Äù",1627254860
72,Pixar,Fair enough.,1627254478
73,Pixar,The incredibles is my all time favorite Pixar movie cuz of the action packed scenes. Onward is my second cuz it's so satisfying and it makes my smile a lot. Coco is my 3rd and my current obsession cuz of its hilarious characters and great story line. It also has a realistic villain. Ratatouille is just so satisfying to watch.,1627253349
74,Pixar,I'd guess that when you're a kid you aren't entirely sure if your gender identity but as you get older you learn who you are and your emotions transition to that gender.,1627253131
75,Pixar,"By today‚Äôs standards ok, but at the time I was blown away by what they did with cloth and hair in that movie",1627252553
76,Pixar,*Perfect except for the animation.,1627252282
77,Pixar,"Thanks!  I think it is such a rich movie with many elements to analyze‚Äîand I do think that all ages can relate to at least one character. If you ever decide to start a family, you should go back and watch it and see how you relate to different themes. It‚Äôs amazing how getting older changes your perspective on books and movies from childhood!",1627251561
78,Pixar,Dude Ramone looks like my uncle wtf,1627251556
79,Pixar,"My humble opinion out of these two, Ratatouille is a masterpiece because it culminates in such an interesting thing to say. Prior to that its a good movie but the ending is what brings it home. Incredibles is brilliant from start to finish. Like I wouldn't think about Ratatouille further if the ending wasn't so good. I still think about the Incredibles because the whole movie is so good. All the jokes land, the action is great, the story is heartwarming, the world building is fantastic, the characters are dimensional and fun, I sincerely think its perfect",1627250898
80,Pixar,Sniff* Beautiful.,1627249680
81,Pixar,"True, i myself haven‚Äôt experienced any of the problems, that Bob has. Somehow i still manage to relate though, it really shows how good the movie is (also from the perspective of a teenager, i can say that school students would like a break from textbooks, and to just analyse a movie).",1627249540
82,Pixar,"I‚Äôm a parent, and The Incredibles just hits different when you‚Äôre a parent. The part where Mr. Incredible wants to die because the rest of his family is presumed dead‚Ä¶then wants to make his family hang back because he‚Äôs not strong enough to lose them‚Äîtears every time. I‚Äôm a teacher and I‚Äôve wanted to teach this movie to explore what ‚Äústrength‚Äù means in all its forms and what makes a hero, but sadly have not done it yet.",1627249112
83,Pixar,oh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,1627248958
84,Pixar,Did a Pixar bracket with my 8th grade homeroom as a way to take attendance this year (lots of virtual teaching) and WALL-E was the winner.  I agree.,1627248933
85,Pixar,My personal favorite is Toy Story 1 but of these two I‚Äôd definitely go with The Incredibles. I didn‚Äôt grow up with Ratatouille but I have seen it in more recent years. The Incredibles was one of my favorites as a kid. Still holds up today.,1627248249
86,Pixar,To err is monster,1627248243
87,Pixar,Plot convenience,1627248143
88,Pixar,Toy Story or Monster‚Äôs Inc for me,1627248111
89,Pixar,"No, I know that one is about cars who are friends and won a Piston Cup and another about superheros. And both are entertaining to watch. What I'm saying is that the movies I mentioned above are more focused on telling you a story, But instead others like UP, Inside Out or Coco they make you experience more emotions, that's what the magic of pixar is about",1627248107
90,Pixar,"Good Dinosaur! Just kidding, best three for me are Finding Nemo, Inside Out and Incredibles 2.",1627246141
91,Pixar,I like this theory.,1627245931
92,Pixar,Ratatouille always makes me hungry and The Incredibles is a Pixar classic. Honestly either or for me. I love them both and can‚Äôt decide! My favorite Pixar movie though is Monster‚Äôs Inc.,1627243954
93,Pixar,OMG MAYBE lol but probably because she hasn't hit puberty yet so her sexuality etc is not decided,1627242741
94,Pixar,SHES TRANS,1627242656
95,Pixar,There are both good but I do not consider them as the best.,1627241995
96,Pixar,"My personal favorite Pixar movie is Wall-E, closely followed by Ratatouille. I'd honestly put The Incredibles around the middle of my list.",1627241722
97,Pixar,I would check out a video by super Carlin brothers I think they covered it,1627241250
98,Pixar,Heard a theory that Anger meant protectiveness (of his daughter) and sadness meant empathy. Both parents seemed very mentally stable so I think that theory is likely.,1627240460
99,Pixar,I think people sleep on Wall-E,1627239933
0,Pixar,"Yes, you heard that right, 6 years, it came out in 2015, and right now it is 2021, which is 6 years. I know, it doesn‚Äôt feel that old, I saw it in the theater.",1627239084
1,Pixar,W h a t? 6 years?,1627239025
2,Pixar,"I onestly prefer Ratatouille


But overall Wall-E is not just the pest Pixar movie, Wall-E is the best movie to ever exist",1627238771
3,Pixar,"The irresponsible, immature choice to not go to the authorities could be there so the target audience can relate better to the adult characters. I think it also creates a great conversation starter for parents to illustrate why asking for help is ok. It could also just be the unsatisfying answer of ""this way is funnier.""",1627238348
4,Pixar,"Coco is top of my lists for ""favorite"" and for ""best.""   Absolute masterpiece.  

But of these two, I'd also but the Incredibles first, and by a fairly wide margin.",1627238159
5,Pixar,"Ratatouille is fantastic but it just doesn't do what the Incredibles did. Everything about the Incredibles was so damn good. Honestly I feel like Ratatouille's plot just wasn't as active or ambitious, I wasn't really blown away by it, I just had a great time with it",1627237690
6,Pixar,"The show reminds me of every other disney channel style show. It feels like it's marketed at 9 year olds with humor and themes completely departed from what monsters inc meant to all of us 20 years ago. If they started from a clean slate, it would probably be the best disney tv show being made nowadays but the truth is they started standing on the shoulders of giants and have ended up just barely reaching off the ground. It's sad to watch the legacy of monsters inc so horribly tainted, and i'm sure pete docter and all the other og's are watching it disgusted, seeing what's happened to their precision and hard work since upper management saw a profit to be made in the short term.

If i was 9, I'm certain i would love the show but i'm not 9.",1627237562
7,Pixar,"You are not alone. I had the same experience. I didn't care about the movie until, out of nowhere, I gained interested in the movie. I watched all the trailers and I didn't get any spoilers. Remember I didn't even care about the movie, but a few days ago I just needed to watch no matter what, I can't explain but I felt something. I didn't know anything about the movie, so when I watched the ending, I can't explain what happened. The movie hit me in way no other movie has done before.",1627236299
8,Pixar,"I had no idea Ratatouille was so popular, it's close to the mid bottom on my list, whereas Incredible sits safely at the top spot. 

There's something about self-narrated stories that throws me off, dunno what it is.",1627234798
9,Pixar,No worries,1627234694
10,Pixar,I thought the same thing. Alberto and Gulia planned that surprise.,1627234500
11,Pixar,"Oh ok, sorry for the misunderstanding. I agree aswell.",1627234166
12,Pixar,I was talking about the superhero genre but yes I totally agree with brad about animation not being a genre but a medium,1627234120
13,Pixar,"Ratatouille is my pick between both movies, though my favourite Pixar movie is Soul",1627233939
14,Pixar,Um read your comment again.,1627233663
15,Pixar,"Wall-e is a masterpiece with a vital message, I don't know if it's the best pixar movie because there's too many great ones, but it's for sure my favorite",1627233608
16,Pixar,I like Wall-E better than Ratatouille. I think it represents a greater feat of storytelling.,1627233522
17,Pixar,I‚Äôd go F tier. But I uniquely loathe that movie,1627233282
18,Pixar,That‚Äôs a funny way to spell Inside Out.,1627233247
19,Pixar,"I‚Äôd like to point out your use of the word ‚Äúgenre‚Äù. And, according to Brad Bird, the director of both films, he talked about how Animation is not a genre. Something I noticed. Idk",1627232520
20,Pixar,I think WALL-E is up there tbh,1627232497
21,Pixar,Both but Ratatouille is slightly better,1627232127
22,Pixar,"I think Finding Nemo is actually the best, but between those two, Ratatouille. I don‚Äôt get the Incredibles hype.",1627232085
23,Pixar,"You are absolutely correct, Finding Nemo is the Best",1627231421
24,Pixar,I didn‚Äôt say it was‚Ä¶,1627230908
25,Pixar,"Wow, I‚Äôm glad someone finally agrees, instead of calling me an idiot for not liking it!

An you really should see Onward! It‚Äôs funny and heartwarming, and one of Pixar‚Äôs best IMO.",1627230869
26,Pixar,"If not one of these 2, what do you consider the best?",1627230599
27,Pixar,Ratatouille has always been my favourite,1627229861
28,Pixar,"Yes! Agree with you on Ratatouille being overrated. No one else seems to agree but I‚Äôm with you! After watching it it never really stuck with me, and to me is one of the more bland Pixar films. Monsters U was hilarious! Not as good as Monsters Inc but still lots of fun. I have yet to see Onward.",1627228856
29,Pixar,"I don‚Äôt think either of those are the best, but if I had to pick I‚Äôd go with Incredibles.

Mind you, I have two Pixar lists: ‚Äúbest‚Äù and ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù",1627228701
30,Pixar,"I personally like Ratatouille more, but I can see how some argue how Incredibles is better.",1627228596
31,Pixar,Toy Story 2 is my favorite (I‚Äôve only watched 1-3) and this seems to be an unpopular opinion but I will never change my mind! :),1627228353
32,Pixar,"Those are both very good movies, but to say they are easily the best two Pixar movies is quite frankly nonsense. Maybe they where ten years ago but there have been several movies that have been equal to or better than both of those.",1627227510
33,Pixar,"I have a history on this sub, but it's on my personal account",1627227297
34,Pixar,ratatouille is better,1627226039
35,Pixar,"[A thorough answer to your question. ](https://youtu.be/n4byoPV0VFA)

But if we‚Äôre honest, it‚Äôs so that the main cast can represent diversity, thereby appealing to an international audience of both boys and girls. That‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs not any kind of plot reason.",1627225116
36,Pixar,both are equally good imo.,1627224159
37,Pixar,"My personal favorite Pixar movie will always be Coco, but I've always put Incredibles as the best. The plot, the humor, the character depth and analysis, the music, the pure entertainment and action...it's a masterpiece.",1627224120
38,Pixar,"Ratatouille is overrated IMO because it doesn‚Äôt offer the thrills that other Pixar movies offer, which for some isn‚Äôt an issue but for me isn‚Äôt necessarily my taste. The Incredibles 1 and 2 are  the best Pixar movies made along with Toy Story 1-3.",1627222392
39,Pixar,"For some reason Ratatouille refuses to stick in my mind. every time It comes up my brain immediately goes ""Oh yeah! Ratatouille exists! that movie is great! how did i forget about Ratatouille?""

so for that reason alone I have to give it to Incredibles.",1627221932
40,Pixar,"Incredibles by far imo every character is important and memorable even the small characters like burney or the old lady at the beginning even Edna could be considered a side character (this could also be because I‚Äôve seen the movie so many times I‚Äôve almost memorized the entire script) whereas I don‚Äôt think the other chefs besides linguini, skinner, remmy, colette, and technically gusteau are memorable at all, there‚Äôs that one guy that killed someone but there‚Äôs no good side characters. Also the villain of the incredibles is one of the best villains ever, I‚Äôd argue skinner is just ok not good not bad. And another point I wanna make even though it‚Äôs not really ratatouilles fault incredibles is genre defining it‚Äôs still considered one of the best superhero movies whereas there isn‚Äôt really any good cooking movies I‚Äôve ever heard about. But then you could argue ratatouille is more of an original idea too. I‚Äôd say based on the villain, memorable characters and overall pacing incredibles is much better and it‚Äôs more relatable to let down your family and want to be better than not live up to someone else. Again all my opinion id be curious to hear if someone disagrees",1627221516
41,Pixar,"It's interesting how opinions differ,  I don't care for either Ratatouille or The Incredibles.  I would vote for Finding Nemo as the best overall.  My personal favorite is Wall-E, but I know many people didn't like the environmental messaging.",1627220856
42,Pixar,Of those two Ratatouille. But the best PIXAR film HAS to be Finding Nemo.,1627220137
43,Pixar,"Good to know, though it did feel like theres just too many continuity points that wouldve lined up with this.",1627219467
44,Pixar,Nicely done! You really captured the warmth of the town and the warmth of their characters,1627218702
45,Pixar,oh boy,1627217854
46,Pixar,How ON EARTH is Ratatouille UNDERRATED???,1627217784
47,Pixar,"Monsters university, pretty easily.",1627217751
48,Pixar,Keen observation.,1627217695
49,Pixar,"No just a B tier movie, in my opinion.",1627217445
50,Pixar,Seriously. You are comparing Cars to The Incredibles?,1627217404
51,Pixar,I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say it: Up isn‚Äôt a masterpiece.,1627217117
52,Pixar,"It was pretty predictable, but it was still decent (which says a lot for a Cars movie).",1627216964
53,Pixar,I'd really like to see those panels once they are done!,1627209227
54,Pixar,"I think that's an interesting thought, but it would kinda take the role of Gusteau as the mentor of Remy away, since he wasn't the real genius behind his recipes.

Also the director of the movie already denied that theory on Twitter (https://twitter.com/BradBirdA113/status/1220882201258016768).",1627205995
55,Pixar,Well the whole point of the movie teaches us that no emotion is a bad emotion,1627205674
56,Pixar,"I hate the MIFT team, and the message Disney seems to be sending to its young audience with that plotline. As if Tylor is supposed to be wrong for wanting to be a jokester...really Disney?",1627201913
57,Pixar,"It's not the worst. But I really hate the message it seems to be sending so far. ""Yes, kids, following your dreams instead of staying in a crappy workspace with coworkers you clearly hate is selfish. How dare you abandon the single most annoying group of people in the world because you want to do something better with your life. I'm sure they mean well, even though they have consistently refused to listen to you whenever you try to tell them - ten thousand times already, at this point - that your position in their line of work is TEMPORARY. You need to be loyal to them because they'll be sad if you aren't."" Bull crap. News flash, Disney: the MIFTers are not the quirky, misunderstood group of underdogs you think they are. If I were in Tylor's shoes, I would have severe brain damage by now. He cannot leave MIFT fast enough.

With that said, I'm really only watching it for the Mike and Sully subplots. It's a pretty casual and mindless watch for me. And I really liked episode three, to be completely honest.",1627201451
58,Pixar,This is probaly as good if not better than the last artwork,1627200990
59,Pixar,Bacause I think it was better to watch when there was men and women,1627196607
60,Pixar,"Time book store, Singapore",1627189723
61,Pixar,I too have wondered this ever since I first watched the movie 6 years ago.,1627189661
62,Pixar,"Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen regardless of genre or medium. It captures the college experience in far greater detail than most of the movies it parodies, it interjects unique approaches and concepts, brilliant pacing that hits in acts 1-3 (and goes crazy in act 4), kids love it, adults love it, random idiots love it, platinum hit.",1627188614
63,Pixar,Also Monsters U. is a masterpiece through and through.,1627188404
64,Pixar,It‚Äôs equal to the good dinosaur for what it‚Äôs worth.,1627188356
65,Pixar,"That ain't Coco, that's Miguel.",1627186965
66,Pixar,Where it's at?,1627186743
67,Pixar,"Based on the adults, it looks like one emotion takes dominance (dad was Anger, Mom was Sadness).

Kind of dark, when you think about it.",1627185812
68,Pixar,"I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but I love both Monsters movies, hoping I will love the show too.",1627185447
69,Pixar,"Maybe because when you‚Äôre young, you‚Äôre still developing and learning who you are, so you‚Äôre not set in one particular way or mindset yet.",1627183353
70,Pixar,Andavo A Cento All'Ora,1627181252

73,Pixar,Cute,1627172958
74,Pixar,"not sure,id imagine the real reason was that the film makers didn‚Äôt s want the entire main cast all being female,but most people like using this as a way to theorise that riley was genderqueer,which is pretty cool",1627171091
75,Pixar,They're adorable! I love your style!,1627168797
76,Pixar,"I can‚Äôt see how anyone could reasonably hate it, I have found it to be awesome, funny, great pacing, great voice acting, fun. Yes the animation isn‚Äôt the same as Monsters U and there seems to be a little disconnect in the Monsters Inc. operation in the movies and the kind of casual company leadership shown by Mike and Sully in the TV show, but that‚Äôs all nitpicking, it‚Äôs really good so far.",1627166155
77,Pixar,AWWW THEYRE SO CUTE!!,1627165648
78,Pixar,It's fun and charming but lackluster in messages and emotion compared to the film,1627165188
79,Pixar,Anyone else also ship Luca and Alberto? :),1627162399
80,Pixar,Thank you! It‚Äôs digitally done with Procreate :),1627161033
81,Pixar,Ice cream,1627160300
82,Pixar,The only reason I like the show is because I loved the movie. The show is okay but not great,1627159823
83,Pixar,"I will give my humble opinion. Luca is a very, very good film that has a simple and very funny plot, but it does not have that ‚Äûmagic‚Äú that Pixar puts in his films. But maybe not movies like cars, monsters, incredibles or wall-e. This movie is positioned to be pixar's ‚ÄûSummer hit‚Äú, along with the famous phrase ‚ÄûSilenzio Bruno‚Äú that more than one will remember, but I repeat, it's still a very entertaining movie",1627159137
84,Pixar,HELL YEAH,1627158041
85,Pixar,Its cute. It is going beyond Monsters Inc.  And it is covering different topics.,1627157292
86,Pixar,Following because I'm in the same position as OP,1627157053
87,Pixar,Them working at the post isn't what we expected. It doesn't lead us to the original where Sulley is a prominent scarer,1627156796
88,Pixar,can you explain to me how the ending was a let down ?,1627156712
89,Pixar,Ah I love ‚Äòem sm. I need a sequel or something! Gray drawing,1627155046
90,Pixar,Why must almost every fucking dinosaur movie be like that?,1627150995
91,Pixar,"Toy Story 4 sucked.  It ruined the franchise.

As for Luca, it gets better upon each rewatch so I suppose it belongs here in some way.",1627149553
92,Pixar,I agree TS4 shouldn't be here.,1627149460
93,Pixar,"I don't. Good movie, though, don't get me wrong.

My Pixar non-masterpieces include Luca, Soul, TS4, Cars 2 &amp; 3, Good Dinosaur, and Bug's Life.",1627147369
94,Pixar,"Yeah I agree, there were good parts but some parts didn't feel right.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jk, I disagree that was just another generic and vague criticism to add onto this list, most actual criticisms tend to leave information out or forget about certain important plot details that explain the film quite nicely imo.",1627146910
95,Pixar,"This is a redraw of one of the scenes in Luca! Nicolle Castro, one of the artists who worked on Luca, served as the inspiration for the characters' designs in this drawing! I just love her rendition of the characters!",1627146493
96,Pixar,I think it‚Äôs better than monsters inc,1627146197
97,Pixar,It's an entertaining movie but the ending was a let down.,1627144778
98,Pixar,"Toy Story 4 is really bad, not gonna lie. I‚Äôm fine with the rest of the list, and I‚Äôd put Luca right at the edge of it.",1627144145
99,Pixar,Lol Toy Story 4 is definitely not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination,1627143902
0,Pixar,"I didn't even know people hated it. I absolutely loved that movie, I loved Monsters Inc. too. Monsters at work is also great while we're on the topic",1627143504
1,Pixar,"I agree! The point of what I'm trying to say is that it's a good movie, but it feels very different than the first movie, so people that are fans of the original aren't guaranteed to enjoy the prequel, as it's quite a different movie",1627143500
2,Pixar,Yeah I see that. But at the same time I could imagine that was how Mike and Sully really were when they were college students,1627143350
3,Pixar,"Not entirely different, sure, but different enough to feel, well...different.

Mike in the first movie was more witty and had a fun kind of sourness to the way he reacted to things. 
Sulley was more mature, which makes sense.

The differences aren't inherently bad, but they are, obviously, differences. That just means people who might relate to one won't relate to the other :-)",1627143066
4,Pixar,"Yeah the core of it is good but outside of Woody and Bo‚Äôs arcs, it falls flat. It doesn‚Äôt balance time with the whole gang well like the others do.",1627142825
5,Pixar,"Nah, it doesn't look understanding",1627142702
6,Pixar,[deleted],1627142674
7,Pixar,"Buzz literally sat passenger seat &amp; buckled himself in the pizza planet truck before admitting he was a toy

this meme barely makes sense",1627142543
8,Pixar,His teeth look unnervingly square here,1627141641
9,Pixar,"I wouldn‚Äôt particularly say their ‚Äúpersonalities are different‚Äù, Mike is still Mike and Sully is still Sully",1627141427
10,Pixar,I love Luca because it doesn‚Äôt really try to be an artistic masterpiece. It‚Äôs just fun and entertaining. Not quite an emotional roller coaster like up but still fun.,1627138664
11,Pixar,i would have liked to see it,1627138223
12,Pixar,"Lauren Faust was working with Sony Animation to make a movie about Medusa, but it got cancelled.",1627136864
13,Pixar,"Soul and Toy Story 4 are technically ‚Äòbetter‚Äô, but boy do i enjoy watching Luca way more. Heck, if I were to rank it, I would put it top 8 Pixar films. It‚Äôs just so much fun, and somehow, it‚Äôs better every time I watch it",1627136158
14,Pixar,"I enjoy MU and MI.

Both were good just in different ways.",1627136078
15,Pixar,"I know its a really hot take, but I'd add Coco and Inside Out to the list of ""masterpieces"" that Luca is better than. Just never been a huge fan of those two and they feel super overhyped to me",1627135197
16,Pixar,"I‚Äôve never heard of this Medusa film, what is it?",1627134980
17,Pixar,Yeah sure ;-;,1627134313
18,Pixar,Lmao I love you.,1627134256
19,Pixar,"I thought Luca wasn't a masterpiece, just a good, low-stakes Pixar film about being yourself. Even though I'd rank it higher than Soul, it's just not meant to be the same type of film as Soul.",1627130264
20,Pixar,Agreed,1627128509
21,Pixar,"It's called being best friends.  
People who ship them obv want them to kiss, go on dates, blush stuff",1627119858
22,Pixar,"I couldn‚Äôt agree more. They have sequels and at least shorts of all the other movies, but with A Bugs Life they just left it at that and never came back to it‚Ä¶ ever. I reckon for the sequel maybe they could‚Äôve found some other theme that could revolve around ants, and maybe even come up with a new villain?

But hey, they could be doing it like finding nemo, and waiting years before they actually make a sequel‚Ä¶",1627119462
23,Pixar,Aww thank you :D,1627118727
24,Pixar,Thanky so much :)) I use Krita (it's free),1627118712
25,Pixar,"Agreed, way too much oxygen. Plus, whale carcass doesn't just float into your mouth on lend.",1627118551
26,Pixar,"I think it's useful to have a word to describe a type of relationship which is more unique and important than friendship, but not necessarily sexual. 

I don't want to give you the impression that there isn't ambiguity here, because there are people who exploit the perception of tender, innocent physical contact of what we might call ""friendship"" in order to fulfill their sexual desires. This is a risk we must be vigilant of. 

But what other words exist to describe a type of friendship with a person you trust enough to let them treat you in the tender way that Luca treats Alberto, trusting that they are not taking advantage of you?",1627118508
27,Pixar,I would watch Luca over onward anytime.,1627117802
28,Pixar,Thats friendship bro,1627116882
29,Pixar,"Depends what you mean by ship. It's wierd if you think that a relationship between kids must involve some kind of licentious illegal activity, but if their relationship means giving one another the acceptance and care they never recieved from their family, then that sounds pretty pure to me.",1627116390
30,Pixar,"Yeah Wall-E is very meh to me, I used to hate it as a kid.",1627115592
31,Pixar,I agree. It‚Äôs fantastic in so many ways but it‚Äôs just a bit too small to be on this list,1627115532
32,Pixar,"I like the fan theory that it's an instinctual aspect in all toys. Much like how when incoming objects are near, we may flinch.",1627115339
33,Pixar,Toy story 4 is a must watch imo. It's the perfect ending for woody,1627114430
34,Pixar,Luca is my favorite Pixar movie since toy story 3. So yeah I think it‚Äôs okay.,1627113329
35,Pixar,Do people hate it? I get the feeling it‚Äôs good not great so not much discussion around it.,1627112521
36,Pixar,I see that üëÄ,1627111969
37,Pixar,It's funny charming and heart warmed but too generic and not ambitious enough to be considered a masterpiece for me and for me 100% no where near as good as Soul which is top tier ambitious,1627111878
38,Pixar,Toy Story 4 is excellent a brilliant movie. Just look at IMDb and rotten tomatoes to see,1627111632
39,Pixar,"There‚Äôs been way more Mike, and I think he looks more normal. Sully walking is way off",1627104603
40,Pixar,"I definitely like Luca way more than Wall-E. That movie is one of my least favorites. I don't hate any Pixar movies, there are some I just don't love and that's one of them",1627103261
41,Pixar,"I 100% agree, I honestly posted here to gauge the interest. I ordered mine as soon as it went up and agree it‚Äôs kind of discouraging it‚Äôs still available and almost everything else is sold out.",1627103003
42,Pixar,I actually find it slightly similar to Brave.,1627102194
43,Pixar,I know lol,1627102093
44,Pixar,"I really hope that's true because I really want Woody, Buzz, and Mr. Incredible",1627101734
45,Pixar,üôÇüëç,1627101092
46,Pixar,Luca‚Äôs animation alone makes it rather gorgeous and easy addition to this group. I‚Äôd remove Toy Story 4 and Inside Out (controversial I know lol) from this group though,1627100845
47,Pixar,It‚Äôs available [here](https://creations.mattel.com/products/pixar-spotlight-series-kevin-figure-hbl29). I believe this is the only place it‚Äôs currently available and it can only be ordered online.,1627100541
48,Pixar,"I ordered mine last night. It came out to $51.00 after tax and shipping, but based on the images and [this review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6SPsKcfVZU), I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be worth it.

The only bad part is that it says ‚Äúships on or before November 8,‚Äù so it‚Äôll probably be a long time until I can see it in-person, but I‚Äôm sure the wait will be worth it too.

I‚Äôm surprised it still hasn‚Äôt sold out yet - usually the Comic Con stuff goes quick. This is worrisome because if this performs poorly, that could put the future of the Pixar Spotlight Series in question.",1627100400
49,Pixar,same director,1627100167
50,Pixar,"I believe those were ‚Äúleaked‚Äù via retailer listings and/or revealed at the toy fair a while ago but none have actually been released yet, besides Kevin.

WALL-E is also expected to be released per a ‚Äúleaked‚Äù retailer listing.",1627100111
51,Pixar,where do you find these,1627100082
52,Pixar,"I had always assumed it was someone involuntary, but he definitely snaps out of it all will a few times during the series",1627099305
53,Pixar,"I'd consider it among Pixar's ""masterpieces"", yes. Not because it is similar to other Pixar ""masterpieces"", but rather because it isn't. It does not use the formulas other Pixar movies use, and instead uses a different method to tell a wonderful yet simple story that is memorable.",1627098648
54,Pixar,"All of them actually, there isn‚Äôt a Pixar movie I don‚Äôt enjoy. I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate any of them because they (at least the older ones) were part of my childhood. I remember as a kid (out of the non master pieces) I enjoyed cars and cars 2 (that spy music gets stuck in my head) and even though I haven‚Äôt watched it in about a decade, I do remember that I really liked a bugs life when I was young. I just love them all.",1627098256
55,Pixar,"I love MU. It adds so much depth to the Monster World. Not my favorite, but it's still a great movie",1627097095
56,Pixar,I thought it was BETTER than Soul. I‚Äôve watched Soul three times and two of the three times I fell asleep about halfway through. I‚Äôve watched this movie about four times and it keeps my attention the whole time lol,1627096588
57,Pixar,STOP I CANT THATS SO CUTE OMG! i love your art style! what software do you use?,1627096301
58,Pixar,that looks so cool omg!! is that done digitally or traditionally?,1627096233
59,Pixar,Yeah they never make Kevin baby merch,1627094637
60,Pixar,"I'd say it's just because the writing style is quite different. Characters are younger so their personalities are different as well. And a lot of the character designs don't follow the vibe the first movie set up.

It's a fine movie, but it's very different than the original movie in a lot of ways, so it turned away some fans that didn't like the new style. Same for the new show",1627094476
61,Pixar,"Toy Story 4 ruined the series for me for a good 6 months or so because it left such a bad taste in my mouth.

 I care a bit too much though, so take that as you will :p",1627094172
62,Pixar,People hate it? Not me. I thought Pixar absolutely nailed college life in a family-friendly way.,1627094065
63,Pixar,"It was far better than Soul IMO. It‚Äôs not quite a masterpiece, but then again, I‚Äôd call Monsters University and Onward masterpieces, so what do I know.",1627093527
64,Pixar,"Doesn‚Äôt really seem like a Pixar-tier movie; now, Me &amp; My Shadow from DreamWorks‚ÄîThat‚Äôs a movie I‚Äôm sad to see go up in smoke.",1627093343
65,Pixar,"Yeah, it seems like the movie just wasn't very far into production before getting cancelled. That happens a lot in the film industry.",1627093196
66,Pixar,"It sounds like the movie didn't get very far in development before getting cancelled. It seems like the problem wasn't ""the product was bad"" as it was ""we can't figure out what to do with it in the first place"". Lots of movies in Hollywood are conceived but never get off the ground. I bet Pixar has plenty of other movie concepts that just never went anywhere.",1627093135
67,Pixar,Wow!!!,1627092938
68,Pixar,"People often get upset about cancelled projects, and I can't fault people for being unhappy about losing out on a movie that they thought sounded interesting. (personally I'm mad about Lauren Faust's Medusa movie getting cancelled) But sometimes projects get cancelled because they just aren't working out. The movie probably wasn't turning out well and it's better to end a bad project early in development than to keep spending money and end up with bad film that loses money and makes your studio look worse.",1627092585
69,Pixar,I just wish I could have  seen baby sully instead of just baby Mike  I thought that would have been cute,1627092453
70,Pixar,Well said,1627092021
71,Pixar,It's also possible that freezing is just instinct for all toys.,1627091986
72,Pixar,Its the most mind numbingly boring and the most mind blowingly beautiful film I‚Äôve ever seen,1627091971
73,Pixar,"Obviously, he‚Äôs blending in with the common group",1627090747
74,Pixar,Yes!,1627090283
75,Pixar,Lmao Toy Story 4 doesn‚Äôt belong on there. It‚Äôs a good movie but easily is the most divisive of this bunch. Personally I‚Äôd put Luca right on the cusp. It‚Äôs almost there but it‚Äôs a bit too slight to make it into the 9/10s and 10/10s for me.,1627089493
76,Pixar,Personally ranked pretty low on my list but the animation itself was unbelievable.,1627087679
77,Pixar,So good! Next time make a video while making it I always love watching those!,1627087298
78,Pixar,"I dont think its a masterpiece. I adored the movie and thought it was fun to watch, cute, funny, and very charming. But not a masterpiece. I dont think its concept was used in an interesting Pixar way so its not as unique and magical the way greater known pixar movies are. In terms of their own catalogue of movies... i wouldnt call it a masterpiece. Its not going to be very memorable compared to the classics. Its just not the same kind of movie. Its a simple movie. They didnt give us anything we havent seen before",1627086882
79,Pixar,We probably wouldn't have Inside Out so I'm glad it was never here,1627085256
80,Pixar,"It's a very well done animation, with a ""simple"" history but rich in details and soundtrack work. The plot, even is simple by ones, is well build, with good reasons and motivations by it players. So yeah, I consider this movie a masterpiece.",1627085031
81,Pixar,"Yeah it‚Äôs worth watching, it‚Äôs just not as good as the first 3 movies but it was still solid and enjoyable.",1627084836
82,Pixar,"haven‚Äôt watched Toy Story 4, is it worth watching? but I agree MU was better than Incredibles 2.",1627084698
83,Pixar,"I‚Äôm curious why people would hate MU, I thought it was the perfect prequel to Monsters Inc.",1627084621
84,Pixar,It's literally fun,1627084359
85,Pixar,It‚Äôs so good. I go back to it every now and then.,1627084224
86,Pixar,"It's a guilty pleasure for me, I honestly think it's objectively the studios worst movie apart from The Good Dinosaur but I still find it entertaining.

It feels more like something Blue Sky, Illumination would make as well as a lower tier Dreamworks movie, if any of these other studios had made it, it probably wouldn't have gotten nearly as much hate, people just expected every Pixar movie to be a masterpiece and to be fair (though some people debate about Car's 1) I do think all of their movies were masterpieces until Car's 2. 

The problems come from a lot of people not liking Mater to begin with, the movie having a weird spy focus come out of nowhere when compared to the first movie and some parents probably didn't like how bizarrely violent it was. Also the villains plan doesn't really make any sense. In reality, he wouldn't have really made green fuel look bad by sabotaging his own brand, everybody would just move to a competing brand and we know there's at least Dinoco in the car's universe so unless Axelrod's company bought it up without it being stated, he doesn't have a monopoly on fuel and if the cars were so concerned about switching to green fuel than other companies would surely be at work on it like how in real life a lot of car companies are suddenly trying to compete in the electric sector now.",1627083775
87,Pixar,Well if he thinks he‚Äôs stranded on another planet than presumably he‚Äôd think the indigenous inhabitants (aka Andy‚Äôs Toys) probably know more about surviving there than he would.,1627083634
88,Pixar,"It was too similar to Rio which I overall liked, with this being Pixar, it probably would have been slightly better but I can see why they wouldn't want to make it look like they were ripping off another movie (Granted Coco was criticised for supposedly ripping off Book of Life but the stories were pretty different in those from what I remember though, this basically has the exact same story as Rio.) 

I do wish this had been made in place of The Good Dinosaur though.",1627082929
89,Pixar,"I like it but I'm not crazy about it. I was just hoping the original movie would get a sequel, like I think it would have been interesting if Boo got older and wanted to try to return to the monster world or something like that.

Also one of the criticisms i've heard about it is that it felt like a G/PG take on 80's college movies like Revenge of the Nerds and Animal House which a lot of adults have seen to dead. I don't see the problem with this though because for one thing, a lot of those movies haven't really aged well and 2nd, those aren't family friendly movies. This movie is a similar movie to those while also being watchable for kids.",1627082686
90,Pixar,maybe people would've liked it more if it came out before Monsters Inc.,1627082481

92,Pixar,"I quite like Monsters University, I didn‚Äôt know people hated it, I just thought it wasn‚Äôt as loved as Monsters Inc and other Pixar movies but I never thought people hated it, I like it quite a bit, it‚Äôs not as good as Monsters Inc, but it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable and fun. It‚Äôs underrated and better than Toy Story 4 and Incredibles 2 in my honest opinion.",1627081827
93,Pixar,Kind of yeah.  Hilarious video.,1627081545
94,Pixar,"They werent very bright or considerate of luca the whole time. Like the reason why luca ran away was because of his parents trying to send him away. Doesnt seem like they were really intended to be intelligent, good parents haha",1627080851
95,Pixar,He assumed he was on another planet and saw how the other presumed inhabitants of this world reacted to humans and decided it was his best course of action.,1627079809
96,Pixar,Ahem. *opens wings*,1627079700
97,Pixar,No idea - it‚Äôs one of my favorites!,1627078738
98,Pixar,Haha,1627078626
99,Pixar,This is my first instant premiere video it would mean a lot if you guys could check it out later tonight or any of my other videos!,1627077971
0,Pixar,He‚Äôs not a Space Ranger! He doesn‚Äôt fight evil or or shoot lasers or fly!,1627077758
1,Pixar,Lol.,1627077650
2,Pixar,"Pretty pumped for it.  Just hope Buzz doesn't look weird lol.  Obviously he's a toy in the Toy Story movies and in the animated TV show he looked pretty much the same.  Now that he's an actual human, I feel like they need to really get his appearance right.",1627077079
3,Pixar,"That‚Äôs kind of relatable, since sometimes when I think of a thing I‚Äôve done a long time ago, I remember the small details rather than the big picture.",1627076995
4,Pixar,"With how far away they were from releasing it, that would've probably been changed",1627076773
5,Pixar,this is incredible I love your design the best,1627076655
6,Pixar,He‚Äôs a space ranger. He saw how the other toys reacted to the ‚Äúhuman alien‚Äù and decided it was his best course for survival.,1627076475
7,Pixar,It's a great movie. I honestly think it's only because it was a prequel instead of a sequel,1627076201
8,Pixar,I liked good dino :( It was giga cute,1627075598
9,Pixar,Yeah. I didn‚Äôt like Gary Gibbs though.,1627075578
10,Pixar,Same here :) especially with the new tv series I think all three are tied nicely together! The tv series is like the monsters inc 2 that people wanted with elements of university in it,1627075550
11,Pixar,"You see the inhabitants of the ‚Äúfar away land‚Äù pretending to be dead, you join in.",1627075341
12,Pixar,True true. I still liked it though,1627075306
13,Pixar,"Not quite as good as the original, but a cute film nonetheless :) I think people hated it because it didn't align with the original movie at all until the very end. Like you saw the factory when they broke in, but the whole college thing probably was not what people wanted to see.",1627075270
14,Pixar,I always assumed their plan if they actually outed him that way was to just grab him and run lol. Either that or they were so worried about him being lost somewhere that they didn‚Äôt even stop to think about that part,1627075248
15,Pixar,Totally agree.  I actually enjoyed Good Dino and the animation was unbelievable,1627075052
16,Pixar,"Honestly I have no idea. I think it's hilarious. Is it a masterpiece? Maybe not, exactly. But it does everything it sets out to do and it does it well.",1627075017
17,Pixar,It‚Äôs just good fun! Right u/bonorsbollege?,1627074998
18,Pixar,Is this you? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ,1627073444
19,Pixar,"Ahh, that's stunning üíï",1627073281
20,Pixar,I can‚Äôt explain because it‚Äôs good,1627073218
21,Pixar,"No, but something tells me that if it did release it probably would've been as forgettable as a Good Dinosaur.",1627072708
22,Pixar,"You can never please everyone. Sequel, prequel, spin-off, remake, etc... There will always be people so attached to the original, that anything next will not be acceptable. 

Monsters Inc is a sweet, emotional film. I imagine attachments to it were really strong for some. A part of their childhood. They'd have their own imagined back story and continuation built up in their heads. 12 years later Monsters University comes out, and no matter how clever and carefully thought out certain plot points are, it'll never live up to what the imagined back story was.",1627071972
23,Pixar,Would‚Äôve been a hell of a lot better than Cars 2.,1627070526
24,Pixar,"I don‚Äôt know, I believe if they cleaned the movie up it could‚Äôve been amazing.I think it was overkill to cut the movie entirely, they just had to clean it up, cut bad jokes and bad plot lines and make the film feel unique, personality for a film goes a long way, just look at Luca",1627069882
25,Pixar,Yeah I figured for the amount of detail it was worth it. The babies are flocked and Kevin has a wire in the neck.,1627068138
26,Pixar,I love thissss üòç,1627067699
27,Pixar,Or.... and hear me out on this one.... If you see a giant fucking humanoid creature on what you believe to be another planet and have nowhere to hide. Your first instinct will be to play dead.,1627067344
28,Pixar,"Unpopular opinion BUT this is why I didn't like Luca. Because of scenes like the parents tossing kids into the fountain or pushing them into a canal. What would they do then? Or when they decide to send their now-human child to school? The rest of the world likely doesn't know about fish humans and his parents won't be there to defend him in case there's a rainstorm before his class. Or if he falls into a puddle. The entire movie was supposed to be ""liberating"" but all I got was second hand embarrassment.",1627066488
29,Pixar,Thank you for this!,1627066107
30,Pixar,That's not bad at all,1627065526
31,Pixar,"$40, it ended up being like $50 with tax and shipping.",1627065494
32,Pixar,"No.  Obviously everyone involved creatively has horrible taste if they let that font ship on a movie image.  Was a license for Comic Serif not available so they picked the next ugliest thing they could find?

I hate the font so much I don't want to see this movie.",1627065390
33,Pixar,How much?,1627065385
34,Pixar,"He DID answer!

35,Pixar,good dino was the greatest animation test of all time,1627064840
36,Pixar,"Gotcha that makes sense, hopefully we can buy them soon!",1627064475
37,Pixar,[deleted],1627064099
38,Pixar,"It looks like there were those other ones, but maybe they will be available later. I'm not sure. I just saw that they're on there but not available to buy.",1627063973
39,Pixar,Y e s.,1627063388
40,Pixar,"And I appreciate your apparent candor hm hm. Most people simply dismiss anything about 

That is true...I mentioned the CDA just as an offhand as the comparison with Waternoose was the main thing. Though, if they did bring his name up, he would also bring it up to them...not to mention the evidence of the newspaper article he had which clued him in on their involvement heh heh.
But that's a good mention about the bathroom scene, as we do hear Randall telling off some CDA off-screen that 'like I told your buddies, I haven't seen anything' (which can be heard to hear, but we R-fans have specialists tah). And we see him trying to 'cool off' as it were from that encounter...and nearly getting a heart attack when Fungus comes in...showing that he really does feel the pressure of the secret goings-on that he's involved in and, for a practiced scarer such as himself, the fact he outright gets freaked out (scared) shows he's not as stone-cold as many think.

Thank you for that.
As for Waternoose...he's got some past too but it's more...erm...richy. His family had apparently been in the CEO position for a LONG time at Monsters Inc....so his desire to keep it was DEEPLY engrained him from family and society, far more than any of the others (who were, like, in their mid/late 30s, while Waternoose was over 100 (and who knows how long he could live past that)). So for HIM to be the one to lose it all was it's own pressures...and while Randall's snap at the end was like a small dam bursting (same as anyone's), one could survive through it. For Waternoose it would be like the Hoover collapsing, taking anything in it's path with it (Sulley, Mike, Boo, and Randall as well). 
To be honest, I have more sympathy for the employee, who works hard to do their best, than a CEO who already had power and wealth to begin with...",1627062715
41,Pixar,"It was. It was just called ‚ÄúRio‚Äù. Hahahaha. 

In all seriousness, I‚Äôm glad they knew to pull the plug. Just wish they had done the same with The Good Dinosaur.",1627061804
42,Pixar,"I'm literally gay and I think shipping them is weird. Even if it was girl and a boy, it would still be quite weird",1627061574
43,Pixar,"I loved this movie. The best movie by Pixar. The is simple and beautiful. It is a trip to our inocent childhood, where we had fun with our friends during the summer.",1627060530
44,Pixar,"It is not about the graphic improvement, it is about character development.",1627060375
45,Pixar,"That‚Äôs really insightful. I really appreciated this in-depth look at Randall as a character.

I feel like Randall was giving them an out because he didn‚Äôt want them bringing his name up to the CDA. You can tell from his scene with Fungus in the bathroom that he was worried about being connected to this, since Boo came from his door.

I do agree, he‚Äôs more of an antagonist than a villain. And like Waternoose, he did think he was fixing the energy crisis.",1627058796
46,Pixar,"By that logic monsters inc and monsters u should be all roars except boo. Cars should be all vrooms. Onward should be all alien languages. And brave should be in gaelic, since that's the lanuage that fits the time period.",1627058186
47,Pixar,"Yeah, Jazz seems like the ""go-to"" music in Monsters Inc. Maybe the Scream Industry was boom in the 1920s and the musical style wsa heard the most and became the most used genre or something heh.
Randall's own theme, incorporating the horns (not a musical person myself heh), makes it sound like he's a threat approaching (hence it's title ""Randall Appears""), but the full clip of the song isn't in the film, where, at the end bits there's like this  little 'magic wisp' sound that kind of take over with the twisty, almost like a playful sneak sort of thing. I think it kind of plays into that, while initially, Randall seems imposing an aggressive, there's some whimsy in the back (his joke with Mike at the start for instance).

If I had to use a term, I prefer more 'antagonist' in relation to Randall. Waternoose, of course, was the 'big bad', but...Randall shows to have a much more complex character than what's presented up front. Looking at their intentions, Waternoose's was to keep his own company a float (one inhereted from his father, Flyod, at a 'tender' age of 100+), while Randall just wanted a higher position in the ladder with respect. 
Their means are also different...Randall's first reaction to finding out Sulley and Mike were involved with the human child...was to give them an out. That's right, the antagonist who openly has a distate for the duo is actually handing them a way out of the situation. Considering, at the time, they knew nothing about the Extractor, Randall could have simply gone to the CDA or Waternoose, and the two would have been in worse trouble.
The CDA are one thing...but what was Waternoose's first reaction to their involvement? BANISHMENT. Yep, Mr. I-Like-My-Top-Scarer was willing to just toss them both into the Himilayas at the get-go. Sure, Randall showed a smile at this development, but we see he's not exactly giddy over it later on...
Point is though, the two were wildly different in their reaction. In effect, one could say Randall inadvertibly was sparing the two from Waternoose's reprisal of them being involved. Or maybe he did know what would happen (after all, he was under Waternoose's spider-legs himself), and was trying to help in his own way.

Of course that's just one big example. Thing is, Randall has more layers than we see, and he's not actively trying to be an antagonist till the end (when he snaps). Sure, he doesn't like the two, he has his reasons, but he's not trying to sabotage them or cheat them (which he hates by the way, as we see) over somehow until the point of no return.
In some ways, he could even be an Anti-Hero of sorts...he's trying to fix the rolling black outs in the Monster World with the...well, lets say 'questionable' project that Waternoose brought him in on. The rewards? Not only would he have fixed the problem for the energy crisis, he'll also get some kind of executive position that will get him the respect he's always wanted (something's he's lost before, another thing we see a glimpse of). Heck, he didn't even plan to fire (or kill, just to remind) the protagonists, saying that they would be working for him.

It's just...there's more to him I believe pulls away from the clock-punch word, 'Villain', and if ya dig a little deeper, you can see the layers that show it.",1627058180
48,Pixar,"This stems from a Pixar movie. I know it is Disney, hence why my expectations are not as high as Pixar movies.",1627057017
49,Pixar,"So the Alberto growing resentful can be hard to watch because the film industry has done the trope to death and generally forces it into films where it doesn't belong. 

However in this film it felt like a natural consequence of who Alberto was as a character. Kids with abandonment issues can have a bad habit of pushing boundaries/pushing people away. They can also develop a very black and white view on relationships ""Either you think I'm the best thing in the world or you hate me"" sort of thinking. Alberto's actions felt very much in line with what a kid with his history would really do in that situation. 

He'd also been made to feel useless by his birth father. Luca made him feel useful because he had knowledge and skills Luca didn't have. Giulia, however, is able to point out where Alberto got things wrong and that makes Alberto feel resentful of her because he feels like Luca doesn't need him anymore. And in Alberto's mind not being needed means being abandoned.",1627055851
50,Pixar,I LOVE IT,1627055627
51,Pixar,"Again if the lip sync isn't good in italian thats on the italian studio which does the lip sync. Nothing that pixar can be blamed for.
If you mean the animation part of the lip sync should be changed for every country it would be a bit of an overkill",1627054420
52,Pixar,yeah but they could at least do the lips sync,1627054290
53,Pixar,"Thats not how film production works.. If the translatioms are bad thats unfortunate but the fault of the studios which do the translations and voice overs. The german one of ratatoulli is awesome
Edit: the main reasom it is in english is that the main audience is english too",1627054220
54,Pixar,WOWOWOW SHE LOOKS SUPER COOL,1627053667
55,Pixar,"Space Jam: A New Legacy also had an A-113 reference. Marvin The Martian's spaceship was styled like a Star Trek ship, and had A-113 as its registration ID.",1627053331
56,Pixar,"The Italian version is not good, ratattoullie should be in french and coco in spanish, American studio or not",1627053325
57,Pixar,Because of Hollywood. So they'll always make in English voices.,1627052837
58,Pixar,"Agreed. This film felt very Ghibli to me. The plot was ""simple"" because the film wasn't driven by plot. It was driven by the character's actions and their relationships. It creates a fuzzy flow of events because it's more reflective of real life where people have multiple things going on at once. 

Alberto felt like one of the most complex characters I've encountered in a kids animated film in awhile. He was clearly dealing with a lot of things all at once. Jealousy, fears of abandonment, a desire to feel useful. And it reflected in multiple ways with his interactions with other characters.",1627052628
59,Pixar,"Because Pixar is a American studio...
Ratattoullie isn't done in french and coco not in spanish. It is possible to watch the movie in Italian so you can go with that",1627051435
60,Pixar,ok but why did they chose to do it in English it take place in Italy nothing stop them from doing it in Italian,1627051287
61,Pixar,Because it was made in America with English speakers which audio was used to animate the characters,1627051196

DWP still distributed DWA films until 2005. Amblin(DWP's parent) is a big investor in NBCUniversal and still has some voting power so if we want to speak technically then Amblin regained some power in the animation company a decade later.

24,DreamWorks,"The ironic thing is that there is nothing themed after Trolls. There are four areas themed after, Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fun Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon.",1627533777

26,DreamWorks,They're already owned by Universal and are probably gonna keep them for quite a while,1627523423
27,DreamWorks,Thank you for not putting Spirit in the bottom almost every does and i love the movie.,1627509158
28,DreamWorks,I feel like the only person in this sub that doesn't like The Hidden World,1627498773
29,DreamWorks,Its fine i have a lot to,1627498001
30,DreamWorks,"As a kid, I always imagined of flying a dragon, just like the ones on the movies, tv shows and spinoffs. I used to imagine flying the Changewing, the Timberjack and the Monstrous Nightmare, but now I want to fly the Skrill, the Ground Grouple and the Thornridge. (Sorry it's kinda hard to choose)",1627497677
31,DreamWorks,"Actually, I disagree, at least, from the standpoint of the production team and not the buisness side of the company. Now this was a few years ago, so I cant 100% vouch on my memory, but a guy who worked on the film came to my high school to talk to us during a career week, and he expressed that they had high hopes for the film, but the box office didnt meet those hopes. 

And when I look through my art book for the film, it is by far the most well-made of art books Ive owned, despite it being my first. To me, that seemed a bit like they expected it to do well, so they went the extra mile on that book.

They did make a jack frost plushie! I got one when it first came out.",1627465923
32,DreamWorks,"I swear Dreamworks has something against RotG because when it was coming out, I saw more Ads and definitely no merch and little child me was so mad because I wanted a jack frost doll.

Meanwhile Boss Bavy was getting merch before the film came out",1627463102
33,DreamWorks,"Those films have franchises because they are what sells. Unfortunatley, the box office did not like Rotg despite the team behind it putting so much creativity into it",1627462825
34,DreamWorks,"Its so underrated! 

Its sad that the Boss Bany and Trolls has a franchise but RotG doesn't",1627462706
35,DreamWorks,Alright. Props for putting Rotg at the top,1627462635
36,DreamWorks,Probably B or C. I like it more then the other Madagascar films,1627457597

85,DreamWorks,"Lol Trolls is a guilty pleasure of mine.  I actually really liked Abominable because it's close to what I want more from DreamWorks which is adventure, family,relatable characters and wholesome life lessons instead of constantly relying on Pop culture references to attempt to appease the audience on which I find lazy (Even though I do enjoy Shrek, Trolls, and the Madagascar sequels and I can excuse Pop culture references from these franchises).",1627112551
86,DreamWorks,"Despite Madagascar not being the best in quality compared to some of these other franchises. The Madagascar franchise (excluding Madagascar 3) is hilarious. Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are probably the funniest protagonist to come out of Dreamworks history. The first movie has a lot of pop culture references, but makes up for it with fast movement, randomness, and dialougue. The second movie actually attempts to make jokes instead of using pop culture references. And you already know why Penguins of Madagascar is funny",1627107682
87,DreamWorks,"Yeah, its so underrated.",1627086195

90,DreamWorks,I‚Äôve seen all of them except 12. Working on watching them ASAP. Whenever I get access to them. I currently have to see movies like Shark Tale and Trolls 2 but I also get to see Rise of the Guardians and Captain Underpants so it all adds up.,1627057488

44,DreamWorks,"Hot take but NO. Everyone wants a sequel until the studio says YES and churn out another Frozen 2. Megamind was a great movie... but didn't end on the note of truly *needing* a continuation, at least from a story standpoint. It's especially concerning when the movie was a flop the first time so there could be important changes made for the second for the sake of what makes more profit and also.... when a film has gone over a decade without a sequel... the tone of the new film will be different and likely worse, because it's hard to capture the magic of a film after 10 years of being removed from it's development.

The animation was fantastic, the characters were really fun to follow, and I found it to be genuinely wholesome and entertaining. I actually teared up a bit in one scene. I found it to be really touching and beautiful when you get further into the story (though as with every movie, it has its flaws, personally I'm not fond of a lot of the music) but besides that, I really have no complaints. Shark Tale really bugged me, mostly as a fellow storyteller who pays attention to a lot of tropes and clich√©s. I really really REALLY hate arrogant protagonists. It's a really overdone trope, and it makes me really not care about what they're going through. I thought it was entertaining enough, and the voice acting cast is phenomenal, but that's just my personal take.",1626653533

As an older viewer, I find it boring and a little weird, but I would never vote it as the worst. The characters are pretty decent, animation is really good, and the concept is fun and wacky in true dreamworks style. Most people say it's the worst, but honestly, having seen every dreamworks movie and viewing them non-objectively, Turbo is MUCH better than movies like Sharktale (imo the worst).",1626651065

My favorite thing about this studio is the risks they take. Pixar and Disney are too cookie-cutter and play it safe.",1626574051
2,DreamWorks,My vote is for Rise Of The Guardians.,1626569754
3,DreamWorks,Gotta go with the original tbh,1626565099
4,DreamWorks,Croods 2 basically wins by default. Didn't care for Trolls 2 and I haven't seen the others yet but I don't have particularly high hopes for them.,1626564832
5,DreamWorks,I literally forget about its existence until you brought it up,1626562345
6,DreamWorks,spirit untamed is even less memorable it's already forgotten,1626558014
7,DreamWorks,"the croods 2, i would want to voice dawn betterman... or be her in a live action. we have a lot of physical similarities and she's an adorable smol bean that i love",1626557967
8,DreamWorks,but it least it gets talked about. which is the only redeeming thing for a bad movie. turbo doesn't even have that going for it,1626557851

13,DreamWorks,"Remember Turbo, the 2013 classic? No? Me neither",1626547943
14,DreamWorks,I think HTTYD is objectively the best. To all of you who voted KFP3 over Madagadcar.... I'm not mad. Just dissapointed.,1626546535
15,DreamWorks,This movie offends me personally for some reason. Like it's just a generic cringe movie but for some reason I get *angry* just thinking about it. Don't know why....,1626546405

most of DreamWorks villains are midi ogre",1626520711
20,DreamWorks,I love that both videos thumbnails are literally just Hammy's face,1626510747
21,DreamWorks,Shark Tale is so bad it's good. So as much I was wanna remove that movie. I need a movie to laugh at how terrible it is. And Boss Baby is just pure garbage and not entertaining at all so I vote for that one,1626510448
22,DreamWorks,One of the Spirit Movies. Spirit Stallion Of The Cimarron or Spirit Untamed. I would probably be a background character or a generic horse.,1626503760

Maybe have a small Dialogue too.",1626500836
24,DreamWorks,"Okay, I respect your opinion. Could you please explain a bit why you don't like them?",1626496196

26,DreamWorks,"Oooh okay, I'll rewatch it over the weekend. Nice to see a fan of Home! From what I remember I enjoyed it, but the dislike/even hate circlejerk from DW fans towards the film is just bizarre. I always like seeing appreciation for the underrated DW films...",1626495004
27,DreamWorks,It is on Netflix! It was added in May,1626494808
28,DreamWorks,Do you know if it's on Hulu or Netlfix? Or where to find it?,1626494771
29,DreamWorks,You should totally rewatch it!!,1626494676
30,DreamWorks,I need to re-watch it.. I remember it as a very cute and creative film tho,1626494619
31,DreamWorks,"Boss baby has dedicated fans? Also, it was the worst case of an oscar snub in history, literally winning over A Silent Voice. I feel for that it definitely deserves not existing.",1626494409
32,DreamWorks,Reminder: Boss Baby won the oscar over A Silent Voice... the anime film about the deaf girl making amends with her childhood bully,1626494314
33,DreamWorks,Anyone who didn't choose Boss Baby are wrong. Like objectively wrong. There's nothing wrong with those other films AND Boss baby stole the *oscar* from A Silent Voice. A SILENT VOICE. It was also mega cringe,1626494249
34,DreamWorks,"Bc they suck, are corny, and no... they do not have more ""depth"" than Disney villains. Like what is this post üíÄ",1626494133
35,DreamWorks,You don't like the first Croods!?? It's literally a masterpiece/:  (second one was mediocre tho),1626494080
36,DreamWorks,All you h*es who didn't know a MAIN character in the croods are fcking tasteless. Like seriously,1626493999

So Thrash is something you guys couldn't guess...

BUT THIS IS?  
Impressive",1626480645
38,DreamWorks,"Am I the only one who's afraid of the idea of giving sequels/prequels to already perfect movies? Honestly, HTTYD is great, but none of the movies or shows are as good as the first one. Megamind is also great, but I feel like a sequel would cheapen it",1626478225
39,DreamWorks,"How to Train Your Dragon is definitely a masterpiece, and both movies are good in their own respects. HTTYD is just way more popular",1626478077
40,DreamWorks,"100% on all of this. Other than rivaling How to Train Your Dragon imo, other than the first one.",1626477969
41,DreamWorks,Valid,1626477782
42,DreamWorks,"Home is a masterpiece about found family and the importance of being accepted for who you are, which also happens to be based on a fantastic book. So no, not the worst Dreamworks film. I'd even claim it could rival How to Train Your Dragon",1626477743
43,DreamWorks,"Boss Baby shouldn't exist. But I'm in a good mood because I'm not seeing any Home slander, so honestly I agree that I wouldn't erase a single one. It feels kinda unfair to throw certain unpopular movies under the bus, because every movie has dedicated fans, and someone who values it",1626477557
44,DreamWorks,Oh okay,1626461708
45,DreamWorks,"Nope! Just the Name of the Character.

If I did a image, Then that would be Insanely easy.",1626461543

64,DreamWorks,Shark tale is abysmal but It entertains me and Boss baby is was worse,1626378359
65,DreamWorks,Shark Tale is an abomination. Saw it once as a very young kid on TV like 10 years ago and it terrified me.,1626372400

However, watch Shrek the Third and Shark Tale at your own risk.",1626281454
80,DreamWorks,Also I‚Äôd say to not watch shark tale unless you want a bad time * megalovana starts playing,1626281004
81,DreamWorks,In Kung Fu Panda 2 when Po catches the cannonball with his hand.,1626280368

83,DreamWorks,"[The True Colors scene from Trolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y-pMJ4IcTY), this scene always gets me every time I watch the movie. The idea that the most optimistic character, Poppy, hits rock bottom and losing her colors is one of the saddest scenes I've seen in an animated movie, then it's immediately turned around when Branch starts singing. Which in turn not only restores Poppy's colors, and then Branch gets his true colors back and isn't grey anymore.

It really turns around one of the saddest moments in the movie for me. I'm getting a bit emotional while posting about it. I know it's not this sub's favorite movie, but it is one of my favorites.",1626278592
84,DreamWorks,[This scene](https://youtu.be/I5JHOYmfPpo) from How to Train Your Dragon. I love how they show the growing bond between Hiccup and Toothless in a moment with very little dialogue and just allow the visuals to tell the story. John Powell's excellent score only adds to the scene.,1626278073
85,DreamWorks,"Croods I thought was just an okay movie nothing more nothing less kinda, it didn‚Äôt have that many aspects of it that applies to an older audience either. Prince of Egypt was just not my cup of tee/ movie, not the type of movie I‚Äôm drawn to. ROTG was a long time I saw and I guess it was pretty good, and I thought the backstory things was very intriguing, maybe it should‚Äôve moved up a row but I don‚Äôt remember it being as good as those movies",1626273144
86,DreamWorks,"M8 you might wanna watch some of that last tier... my favs are The Croods, Flushed Away, and Monsters vs Aliens",1626270351

90,DreamWorks,"It is!!! Surprisingly emotional in the last act too.
Tbh the only 1 thing I had a problem with was Oh, who dragged the film down for me a bit (found him annoying). But tip and the overall story was so creative and weird and fun and I don't understand why people give such a cute, inoffensive film a hard time",1626269936
91,DreamWorks,"I remember pretty much nothing of it just that I wasn‚Äôt invested in it at all and didn‚Äôt like it, and that was as a child so I think that says a lot but maybe I should give it a rewatch",1626265839
92,DreamWorks,"Yeah maybe from a ‚Äúmovie critic perspective‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know I just didn‚Äôt enjoy them that much. Kung fu panda 2 I think had too much action and too little drama for my taste and prince of Egypt was a bit too dark, like it didn‚Äôt have any comical relif and it felt like it should‚Äôve been/ was a live action movie, and I don‚Äôt like live action movies as much usually",1626265707
93,DreamWorks,"Crikey!
You shouldn‚Äôt do a tier list if you‚Äôve only seen a fifth of the movies- especially because most of the movies are from the same franchise.




Also trolls is trash",1626258997

I actually like Shark Tale and watched it a lot as a kid. I thought it was funny and clever. Wallace and Gromit is a classic. Seriously, I can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt seen these!",1626238598

3,DreamWorks,I plan to watch them in the future,1626233649

Steer clear of The Boss Baby. It sucked.",1626233472
9,DreamWorks,"Thanks. I think I will probably watch Shrek and Road To El Dorado. I have watched HTTYD 3  and yeah, it is amazing",1626233348
10,DreamWorks,"So first picks are immediately the shrek series all of them(except the third one) is better than 3 different pixar movies (no malice intended) shrek is just so good. second i would say the penguins of madagascar along with the madagascar series. They‚Äôre all kinda weird but really enjoyable movies. My last two are the road to el dorado and how to train your dragon 3 (im assuming since its not on the list you didn‚Äôt watch it) the road to el dorado is a very charming movie with great artwork, and great colors, with a simple story. Httyd 3 is a masterpiece thats so good i cant say anything without spoiling something.",1626233246

13,DreamWorks,"I completely agree, though I feel more in COMPARISON it's a little overrated, like when people act like it's the best movie ever made and can't respect that everything has flaws. I love the first movie, I just see so many toxic people that make it out to be the best thing ever created, when it's really not. It's outstanding, one of my personal favorites since childhood, but I think people don't often acknowledge that there are better movies.",1626231956

20,DreamWorks,What?,1626223473
21,DreamWorks,"Yeah maybe, I respect that, I‚Äôm not a person who thinks too much about plot holes, I don‚Äôt really see the movie as emotional just as good and I like the story, the characters, the plot is very intriguing etc and I think it‚Äôs underrated bc of shrek 3. But I respect you opinion",1626220396
22,DreamWorks,"My problem with Shrek Forever After is in the plot holes. There are certain things that just don't make sense. For example, why is Puss Fiona's cat? It seems very unlikely they would have met, and why is he a fat house cat? His life was just fine without Shrek. Also, Fiona is hopeful when Shrek meets her. She's convinced her prince charming will save her. We know that when Shrek never showed up, she lost hope, but Charming in the second movie only showed up, what, weeks after Shrek? Did she lose all hope in that amount of time? Also, what happened to the ogres? There are just so many things, along with the lack of humor. If I want a dramatic/emotional film, my first thought is definitely not a Shrek movie. That's not to say they can't play around with different feels, but easilt one of the best things about Shrek is the humor. It was very difficult to swallow without it.",1626219941

Shrek two: can never get too much hype
Shrek 3: maybe over hated, it‚Äôs not a bad movie but it‚Äôs kinda bad for being a shrek movie
Shrek 4: UNDERRATED!!!! Excuse me? I get that everyone gets to have their own opinions but no!!! In my opinion it‚Äôs probably the second best after shrek 2, it‚Äôs slightly darker and may not be as funny but that‚Äôs bc it doesn‚Äôt try to be, but everything else kinda makes up for that!",1626218073

48,DreamWorks,"While I respectfully disagree with Trolls, nope, you're not the only one who didn't find Home that bad. Watched Home on Netflix awhile back, and honestly I teared up too. I really liked the movie, if I stumble across a copy, I might just pick it up on DVD.",1626142793

The humour is definitely different to the previous installments but you can still have a laugh with entertaining characters and subplots. There's also some great emotional moments/scenes as well. 

Overall, I don't understand the seething contempt this film is met with and I agree with OP in it being overhated. I genuinely don't feel as though it's as much of a disaster as the majority of people seem to think.",1626132735

59,DreamWorks,"If the princesses were in the third, than I absolutely agree it's underrated. I guess I don't remember the 4th much at all but I remember it kinda sucking 

...and yea, the first shrek was kinda wack",1626119695
60,DreamWorks,"Oh yeah, that's why I said it's only kind of a joke.  Imo, all those movies might as well be D tier compared to Spirit lmao",1626119013
61,DreamWorks,delete this lol,1626116720
62,DreamWorks,I was shocked when I watched this movie and no one talked about it. Definitely on my top favorite movies list for Dreamworks,1626116203
63,DreamWorks,"Despite this being a joke, Spirit is an S tier film.",1626115963
64,DreamWorks,Every shrek movie is a masterpiece,1626112175
65,DreamWorks,I haven‚Äôt seen it in a while and I don‚Äôt remember it being that great but judging by your review I will revisit it soon,1626111900
66,DreamWorks,"I knew I would get this comment lol. It's all mostly up to opinion, and I'm mostly talking relatively. Shrek is one of my favorite DreamWorks movies, but especially when comparing it to other movies of the time, a lot of factors could have been much better. The biggest thing for me is that the computer animation is behind it's time. I also thought a lot of the jokes missed. Like I said, still one of my favorites, but people still argue in 2021 it's greatness can't be beat, which is why I say it's overrated. As I said, it remains one of my favorite DreamWorks movies, but I think it's far from perfect.",1626111362
67,DreamWorks,according to all known laws of physics there is no way Madagascar and bee movie can bee in this list they look like masterpieces against this movies but they are in it anyway,1626111261
68,DreamWorks,shrek is not overrated Shrek is one of the greatest movies of all time,1626110886
69,DreamWorks,"Like Snow White and Cinderella and them? That's the third one. Also, the first Shrek movie really isn't terrific lol, it's like, ""Love yourself no matter what you look like and who people assume you are! (unless you're short, in which case you're the butt of all jokes and I'll make fun of you the entire movie)"". I know Farquaad was the bad guy, but that always throws me off üòÇ",1626110776
70,DreamWorks,Petition to start recognizing how much the fourth Shrek movie doesn't make sense.,1626110593

Actually... which is the one with the warrior princesses? I forget",1626110583
72,DreamWorks,"The villain of the movie wins despite his death.

He had two goals: night fury extinction and keeping dragons and humans separate.

Both happen",1626110368
73,DreamWorks,They put Bee movie in the same tier... and Croods and shark tale in the same tier below it... I cri,1626109563
74,DreamWorks,"Imagine watching an actual cinematic masterpiece, The Croods, and putting it in simply ""mediocre"". I will never understand the blatant disrespect, and lack of acknowledgement of it's brilliant execution, cinematography, character development and messages. 

But putting the BEE movie above it... this has to be trolling",1626109486
75,DreamWorks,"Also, HTTYD 3 literally had the main characters who started off as teens, become adults, who got married, and had children. CHILDREN!!! no forever teenager ageism. Groundbreaking",1626109139
76,DreamWorks,KFP 3 is one of my least favorite movies... HTTYD 3 is one of my favs... soooo,1626109043
77,DreamWorks,Get *Madagascar* off this list you absolute heathen,1626108925
78,DreamWorks,"Tbh I feel like if your really obsessed with the characters and hiccup/toothless relationship you might have problems with it... but to your average viewer it's just a good, bittersweet movie. We don't read that much into it",1626108878
79,DreamWorks,"No worries, I didn't take it on a bad way.",1626108802
80,DreamWorks,It's so weird to me that TROLLS of all things has a fanbase. They're all like 9 but STILL... it has a FANBASE. ü§Ø Yet Croods doesn't. The world isn't fair üíî,1626108787

83,DreamWorks,"Shrek 3 and Shark tale overhated, KFP 3 was definitely not on par with the others... but penguins in really great, and Flushed Away in fantastic? We love to see it!",1626108581
84,DreamWorks,I thought it was quite interesting. The plot with the boy and that wizard and the sidekicks changing bodies and that thing with play and prince charming trynna kill shrek... it has the most going on I think objectively. Can't see how that could be boring,1626108392
85,DreamWorks,"For real. Shrek movies are dumb fun but not ""masterpieces"" like everyone says. üíÄ I ESPECIALLY don't understand how Shrek 2 is so great... it's the most forgettable shrek to me",1626108263
86,DreamWorks,"ITS MINE TOO

I thought I was the only one (I still think the hate makes no sense tbh)",1626108172
87,DreamWorks,SO IM NOT THE ONLY ONE. an even hotter take... I thought it was the most enjoyable shrek ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the hate this movie gets makes no sense its fucking silly and weird and I love it,1626108129
88,DreamWorks,"Choose home, don‚Äôt remember being even the slightest invested in the movie and it‚Äôs very forgettable. Like there is dreamwork movies that are questionable but they are still fun to watch, then there are movies I haven‚Äôt seen such as baby boss and turbo- which I‚Äôve heard sucks a lot (turbo)",1626103576
89,DreamWorks,"I couldn't agree more. It actually has really good writing and tropes I adore. I'm sorry, but it's my favorite Shrek movie.",1626100834
90,DreamWorks,Let's just say the movie has a lot of issue and we've pointed them all out,1626096889
91,DreamWorks,Fair enough.,1626091995
92,DreamWorks,"Yeah, I just have more fun hating Shark Tale",1626091972
93,DreamWorks,"It's a stage name for the guy who provided the voice of the character. He's a rapper, and quite a good one at that. He features on quite a few songs with Dr. Dre

Edit. Also, sorry if I came across as a jerk in the previous comment. Happens all the time with me, I have no filter on the internet",1626091848
94,DreamWorks,No I don't. Do they really hate Hidden World?,1626091443
95,DreamWorks,"Shrek the Third is garbage no doubt, but there a few genuinely funny moments in there (like Pinnochio trying to avoid telling Charming where Shrek is without lying) and the actual animation is pretty God. Shark Tale to me is just so visually repulsive with only a few mere chuckles at best.",1626091385
96,DreamWorks,"I said the name, not the character.",1626088939
97,DreamWorks,"Looking forward philanthropy. Thanks to the following redditors for sharing first, maybe they‚Äôd like it here.

0,DreamWorks,U seriously think Snoop Dogg is the character?,1626068591
1,DreamWorks,"Exactly. 

While the first Boss Baby was unbearable,  Boss Baby 2, was at least enjoyable to a certain degree. It had fun bits and pretty neat sequences from an animation stand point. I dare say it‚Äôs a mid-tier movie‚Ä¶‚Ä¶at least compared to Trolls or Home anyway",1626067649
2,DreamWorks,"When it comes to ending of the overall story arc, I do prefer HTTYD. While Kung Fu Panda sorta ended in a decent way, HTTYD ended in a very high note. Although, personally it isn‚Äôt fair b/c I have a bias for HTTYD. I still do love Kung Fu Pandora tho. It‚Äôs comes second to HTTYD for Dreamworks greatest works. As an animator myself, HTTYD‚Äôs animation and musical score is an absolute masterclass",1626067246
3,DreamWorks,"I couldn't Disagree with you.

However, Boss Baby 2 actually made me laugh a bit,

It was a hilarious movie, Along with Funny moments.",1626067203
4,DreamWorks,Honestly I didn‚Äôt hate Shrek the Third but that‚Äôs probably because I didn‚Äôt like Shrek 1 &amp; 2 as much as the Internet did.,1626064191

I think my fav is either the fairy godmother from shrek 2 or pitch black from rise of the guardians",1626050855
13,DreamWorks,"No, put Shark Tale in S",1626043819
14,DreamWorks,Okay at least you have a similar thought to me with the troll movies.they are so over rated. I can't agree with most of the other rankings as you have some of my favs at the bottom.,1626038924
15,DreamWorks,I'd honestly rather rewatch shark tale over shrek the third. It's just so much more fun to rip on how bad it is than S3 is,1626038681
16,DreamWorks,Really? I laughed quite a lot when I watched it.,1626035607
17,DreamWorks,"S for Spirit, bay-bee",1626030554
18,DreamWorks,"The Boss Baby isn't a good movie but it's so fascinatingly insane to me that I get some enjoyment out of watching it. Shark Tale is just repulsive to me in its story, characters, and visuals.",1626026303
19,DreamWorks,"I actually liked Shark Tale. 

If you ask me, I would have given The Boss Baby its own tier because it sucked. Puss in Boots would be a bit higher too.",1626026190
20,DreamWorks,"*sees ROTG in the Perfect slot*

Ah, perfectly balanced, as all things should be.",1625994762
21,DreamWorks,"I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about with Madagascar. I put the second one the highest then the first one and then the third one, just like you said",1625993071
22,DreamWorks,I was almost gonna put Kung Fu Panda 2 in perfect but ROTG is my favorite and I sorta felt it deserved that spot alone,1625992995
23,DreamWorks,I really agree with your placement of KFP3 tbh,1625985517
24,DreamWorks,"Spirit in average?  Okay, entire list already invalidated smh",1625980626
25,DreamWorks,I loved in Wallace and Grommet when Grommet revived Wallace with a piece of cheese,1625967958
26,DreamWorks,"The fact that you put Madagascar where you did and put the third one above the second, I really disagree with that. I think the second one is the best, then first, then third. I like all of them though. I also don't think Boss Baby should be under Turbo or Home. I also would put Spirit quite a bit lower. It's definitely my least favorite of the hand drawn movies. Turbo is their worst in my opinion. But Rise of the Guardians is definitely one of my favorites, so I do agree with that",1625966127
27,DreamWorks,not sure how I feel about the HTTYD trilogy not being in perfect... thx for giving RotG the respect it deserves tho,1625962474

30,DreamWorks,Rise Of The Guardians!,1625957533
31,DreamWorks,"Rise Of The Guardians, both my favorite Dreamworks film but also one of my favorite animated films ever. The great trilogies like Kung Fu Panda or HTTYD are great and don‚Äôt really need more movies but I feel like we missed out on what could have been a good franchise with Rise Of The Guardians",1625957086
32,DreamWorks,"Yeah, I missed that Melman did tell them they should stay at the zoo but Alex was so impulsive and so was Gloria, I get that Alex was angry because he was worried especially since he's Marty's best friend but to put all the blame on Marty was just wrong, as a kid I remember I wanted to reach through the screen and pull Alex by the mane lol, like ""ok Alex but Marty did not exactly ask you to go after him""",1625951782
33,DreamWorks,"I don‚Äôt hate it, I liked it, but I was a bit disappointed. 

I didn‚Äôt really see the need to add a romantic story for Toothless and I thought after the second movie that we‚Äôll see Drago again since he was only defeated but not left unable to seek revenge. Also I expected after the second one that the third one will continue exploring some darker themes, not sure what but I liked that the series went for plot elements that are usually not found in ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs‚Äù movies (not saying they are for children, but perceived as children‚Äôs movies) like Hiccup losing his leg and then his fathers death at the end of 2. 

So all in all, the third one wasn‚Äôt bad and objectively it was actually really good but it was just not what I wanted, I guess. Hope that makes sense.",1625950606

It is better to be alone than staying in a toxic relationship like this. You have murdered all my feelings for you. Goodbye!  
I never thought of falling in love with you for saying goodbye someday. But as it happens, you did not give me an option. So goodbye and good luck!  
I hope you can forgive me for all the wrongs I have done to you! I too have no complaints against you! It‚Äôs just that our love didn‚Äôt work out!  
The way you keep on doing things that hurt me, shows how little I mean to you. Let us break up and not get involved with each other for the sake of our sanity. Goodbye!  
It‚Äôs better to say goodbye than saying a thousand lies about how much we love each other. After all, we both know there is no love anymore!  
I never thought of a tomorrow without you. But sometimes life has other plans for us. I don‚Äôt blame you but I blame my fate!  
My heart is shattered. My eyes weep as I say goodbye to you. May you have all the happiness in life that couldn‚Äôt give you!  
Time may heal my broken heart. But it can never erase your memories from my head. Our paths are divided but my love for you will remain the same!  
You are an angel that I couldn‚Äôt keep to myself. It‚Äôs all my fault because I always ignored the blessings you brought with yourself!

37,DreamWorks,Can't wait. I don't mind the animation because we've come a long way from single frame drawings and combining them to make a full length movie.,1625936767
38,DreamWorks,"I haven‚Äôt seen trolls or back-to-backed the KFP trilogy yet, so that leaves httyd, shrek, and megamind.

Megamind doesn‚Äôt need either, and it has a significantly higher chance of ruining it rather than making it better.

Shrek has no need for a prequel, and httyd has no need for a sequel.

I feel like the most interesting thing would be a httyd prequel (that one watches like Star Wars, watching the trilogy and then the prequel). This prequel would explore hiccup‚Äôs life before the opening of httyd 1 first. 

It would showcase his earlier prototypes and failed attempts at shooting down a dragon. It would dive deeper into his relationship with Stoic (and Stoic could talk to Gobber about how he feels about his son). 

It would also look at his relationships with friends, namely Fishlegs and Astrid, although the entire group would be included. It would be cool to see how Hiccup and Fishlegs interact as the two ‚Äúnerds‚Äù on the group, and would be interesting (and also be relatable to many teenagers) to see Hiccup struggle to talk to Astrid.

There‚Äôs also some fan theories that Astrid liked Hiccup but was afraid of being shunned and Fishlegs always appreciated him because they‚Äôre the only two that don‚Äôt laugh at him at the start of the movie. So seeing their angle in rants during time that they spend alone could be cool.

 It could also tie in to the TV shows, showing Dagur and Hiccup‚Äôs relationship before Oswald disappeared.

In my mind, this would take place in the ~year before httyd 1, with the final engineering thing being the thing hiccup shoots down toothless with.",1625923580

43,DreamWorks,To be fair Melman wanted to stay at the zoo but Alex and Gloria forced him to go with them,1625907104
44,DreamWorks,I'd love to see the story of Nightlight and how he became Jack frost. Maybe it could be set after the first film and its Jack processing the memories,1625906120
45,DreamWorks,Take this Random award...,1625897502
46,DreamWorks,"Another Biblical epic as Joseph was fantastic just like Prince of Egypt. Joshua would make sense as you could bring back Val Kilmer to voice Moses. Have him ascend to heaven. Have Rahab the prostitutie that hid the spies and the battle of Jericho. They have so much content to make a sequel to Prince of Egypt. Even not doing Joshua, they could do David or Daniel.",1625895481

Know this is 100% shit 0% post",1625853243
98,DreamWorks,I really liked the first croods are you joking or do you mean that,1625853154
99,DreamWorks,Every shrek is a B? And can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious about croods being a masterpiece‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt seen it.,1625849951
0,DreamWorks,[deleted],1625848964
1,DreamWorks,"and yea, the order matters too (except for the last row)",1625846841
2,DreamWorks,"I don't like The Croods very much, I guess.",1625844739
3,DreamWorks,*Trolls* and *Trolls World Tour*. I definitely find the most fun to watch.,1625844554
4,DreamWorks,Its my second favourite,1625840675
5,DreamWorks,"It was only popular because people wanted Jack Frost, the immortal child, to get with either Rapunzel or Elsa!

I want more people to know the movie for what's in the film itself instead of shipping",1625840634
6,DreamWorks,im not joking i love that film 10/10 film,1625837846
7,DreamWorks,"Because I see it constantly brought up as an ""underrated masterpiece"" so much that it's not as underrated anymore. At least not anywhere near as much as the titles on the poll... (you can only fit 6)",1625837228
8,DreamWorks,"Genuinely curious... are you serious about Bee movie? I mean I thought it was like a 6/10... definately overhated, but... üëÄ",1625837128
9,DreamWorks,"Whether that movie is truly underrated is up for debate. I'd say it was at one point, but when every single time the ""underrated film"" debate comes up, ROTG is listed EVERY time. Sorta like how Emperor's New Groove was ""underrated"" until it became well known and appreciated but people still claim its underrated, when it's not. ROTG has much appreciation and a fanbase now. Even if it's still underrated to you it is no where NEAR as underrated as the titles on the poll.",1625837057
10,DreamWorks,"It is a really HUGE fanbase.... I even think it had the most fanfiction of any piece of media at one point, and is the number 1 ""underrated"" DW film by everyone, perhaps next to Megamind... so no. I don't think it is the ""most underrated"" if everyone is saying that and it has the fanbase the size of mount rushmore.",1625836896
11,DreamWorks,"My ranking is Shrek the Turd 79 millionth, OG Shrek and Forever After are tied for second, and Shrek 2 on top",1625835322
12,DreamWorks,I'm genuinely concerned about the four people who marked BB as their favourite....,1625835202
13,DreamWorks,Thank you! That shows how underrated it is!,1625834940
14,DreamWorks,Definitely,1625834913
15,DreamWorks,Rise of the guardians is the most underrated DW movie! FIGHT üëè ME! üëè,1625834879
16,DreamWorks,Elaborate?,1625833741
17,DreamWorks,100%,1625833032
18,DreamWorks,Same!,1625821918
19,DreamWorks,Sinbad was one of my favourite films growing up,1625815364
20,DreamWorks,I would like to have a stern talking to with whoever clicked The Croods,1625806689
21,DreamWorks,"Yeah because the argument would probably never end, especially Alex who wouldn't stop talking because he was really angry at Marty for escaping from his enclosure, Alex, Gloria, and Melman were not asked to go after him but they were just really worried about their friend which makes sense.",1625804423
22,DreamWorks,"Yeah, I saw Croods: A New Age on Hulu, just found it while browsing awhile back so decided to watch it.",1625802459
23,DreamWorks,Is the sequel on streaming?,1625801528
24,DreamWorks,shrek 4 imo,1625795123
25,DreamWorks,"It's actually unwatchable. The humour sucks, shrek goes through no journey, the jokes and characters are cringe worthy and I can go on",1625794435
26,DreamWorks,I'm glad it's in at least second place. It's my 2nd favorite DW film and one of my top 5 animated films.... but it gets no love or attention *whatsoever* üò´,1625790893
27,DreamWorks,"Oooooh poor Roddy , flushed down his own potty",1625786322
28,DreamWorks,Flushed Away is definitely the most underrated of this lot. It's one that gets way funnier as an adult than a kid.,1625784191
29,DreamWorks,I don't like small foot and I have not seen missing link. So IDK,1625782644
30,DreamWorks,"I've heard a lot of gate against this movie and I don't get why. It's hilarious and my family loved this movie growing up. Some say it's ""vegan propaganda"" which it isn't at all. If what happens to animals in the meat industry bothers them, that's their problem.",1625780848
31,DreamWorks,"It's possibly my favorite DreamWorks movie. I mean, Megamind is my favorite comedy of theirs and I also love How to Train Your Dragon, but this is definitely in my top three. I also have the book series which is very different, but it's good too.",1625780411
32,DreamWorks,I like it too but I think it didn't do super well because there had recently been Small Foot and Missing Link which all were about a similar type of character,1625779610
33,DreamWorks,Where tf is Rise of The Guardians?,1625776309
34,DreamWorks,My vote went to Flushed Away since Bee Movie wasn‚Äôt an option.,1625767789
35,DreamWorks,WHY IS SPIRIT STALLION OF THE CIMARRON NOT AN OPTION,1625766156
36,DreamWorks,"My vote went to Mr. Peabody and Sherman, just really loved the movie, and I do remember some of the original shorts from when I was really young.

Will say, I do like Over the Hedge (borrowed it from a neighbor), and The Croods (saw both the original and sequel via streaming).",1625763108
37,DreamWorks,Same here. I am so happy some one else thinks like this so many people have said it was a dumb movie.,1625762369
38,DreamWorks,Taste. Abominable is one of DreamWorks best movies definitely. It's a shame that no one seemed to talk about it when it came out and nobody does now. I adored it.,1625760152
39,DreamWorks,Prince of Egypt is super underrated,1625759854
40,DreamWorks,I absolutely love abominable so much the visuals the music everything works so well. I also like the Croods and love over the hedge.,1625754302
41,DreamWorks,B move E,1625753575
42,DreamWorks,Abominable deserves a sequel. Great 8/10 and hinted at a sequel at the end. Need more Jin,1625753529
43,DreamWorks,"Croods, Flushed Away, Abominable, P&amp;S and Over the hedge stay underrated sadly üòî",1625753461
44,DreamWorks,"wouldn't say great, but it was good and the hate it gets is ridiculous. The only annoying thing abt it was the alien",1625753303
45,DreamWorks,"You did not put THE CROODS in ""bad"".... 

I automatically do not trust your judgement on anything. üòê",1625753197
46,DreamWorks,"I think that's what the ""other"" option is for, writing in your favorite. Since you commented, I take it you enjoyed Megamind the most.",1625747550
47,DreamWorks,"Honestly, the original Trolls, so voted other. I know it's not a popular choice on this sub, in addition to the characters, I love the heart the movie had.

Also, it's a comfort movie. Saw it after going through one of the hardest times of my life, and it cheered me up. I also like the sequel, but the original has a special place with me.",1625747420
48,DreamWorks,What exactly did you expect when you put on BOSS BABY as one of the options?,1625746346
49,DreamWorks,Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas,1625739325
50,DreamWorks,Where is Megamind,1625725344
51,DreamWorks,The third movie is fine. Why does everyone hate on it?,1625720887
52,DreamWorks,Nice.,1625713390
53,DreamWorks,"Not really, but I still like it a little (I don't even hate it though).",1625713342
54,DreamWorks,Missing some of their best,1625712923
55,DreamWorks,Siri?,1625708687
56,DreamWorks,I take it you‚Äôre still into it?,1625708050
57,DreamWorks,"Seems like you really do like *Trolls* because reading the description of your profile I read that the Snoo is actually Poppy from the *Trolls* franchise, and I was even wondering if that was true before looking at your profile. (Not saying I blame you for it because I had an obsession over it when I was 10-11 years old.)",1625707910
58,DreamWorks,Puss In Boots Does Count As A Shrek Movie I Know It Has Puss In Boots And He Was In Shrek 2 thru 4 But The Movie Puss In Boots Does Not Count As A Shrek Movie,1625694231
59,DreamWorks,"I loved Madagascar 3. It was funny, but it was the visuals that did it for me.",1625690951
60,DreamWorks,same with croods and madagascar 3 i liked those too,1625689173
61,DreamWorks,i actually like monsters vs ailens,1625689134
62,DreamWorks,you are shit head,1625687013
63,DreamWorks,And lol Shrek the Third is so bad that it got its own tier.,1625682385
64,DreamWorks,"Nonsense, Turbo was awesome",1625681039
65,DreamWorks,And thats facts but it's his so.i would say over the hedge is masterpiece and flushed away one higher then where it is,1625678527
66,DreamWorks,I know! I laughed quite a lot when I watched it again recently.,1625674467
67,DreamWorks,"A few agreements and disagreements:

I actually liked Shark Tale 

Bee Movie was so stupid it was good. 

Madagascar 3 rocked imo. The visuals were  s t u n n i n g.

I really liked The Croods.

The Boss Baby absolutely sucked with two u‚Äôs. That‚Äôs how bad it was!

Haven‚Äôt watch Turbo in a longg ass time, so I‚Äôve got no comment.

And then there‚Äôs Shrek The Third, who has its own special tier.",1625674437
68,DreamWorks,This list is not facts,1625673310
69,DreamWorks,Shark tale is a masterpiece smh,1625663136
70,DreamWorks,Where‚Äôs Prince of Egypt and Road to El Dorado?,1625658399
71,DreamWorks, Shrek Forever After is my favorite out of the four movies.,1625627138
72,DreamWorks,thanks,1625611683
73,DreamWorks,Sticking that right on the fridge.,1625610995
74,DreamWorks,Here is the Finishing picture of Dreamworks: [Hiccup from How to Train your Dragon in Mobebuds Style](https://youtu.be/v6RGJ0oxSRE) which was done By Myself as it is Requested By Requested by Requested by Joseph Bevacqua via YouTube,1625610905
75,DreamWorks,Sorry if you got that impression. I was just curious. :P,1625598476
76,DreamWorks,"I'm not sure, and not sure why you're getting agro.",1625598241
77,DreamWorks,Which scene in **Home** did that?,1625598103
78,DreamWorks,"All Hail King Julien, Home, and some others.",1625595190
79,DreamWorks,What are some of those examples?,1625590378
80,DreamWorks,"I've always loved Shrek 2, it built up on the original and gave a great villain in the fairy godmother. As for Shrek 5 I think it's a 40/60 split the 60 leaning towards not happening. As on the Dreamworks wiki page said it won't happen and with the failure that was Shrek 3 and the mediocre reception to Shrek forever after the chances are slim.",1625588908
81,DreamWorks,"Watched Boss Baby recently since I was going to watch the sequel on Peacock. Yup, they used actual photographs in the presentation. Not just puppies, people too (the scene is longer than the clip).

Double checked too, I have the DVD from the original release from Fox.

Puppies in the Puppy Co scene were animated.",1625578969
82,DreamWorks,Definitely a real puppy. They've done it before in previous movies and shows. Not an uncommon practice,1625578931
83,DreamWorks,What does this have to do with DreamWorks?,1625535536
84,DreamWorks,"Goes Shrek 3 as worst, Shrek 4 as okay, Shrek as wonderful and Shrek 2 as OHMYGOSHTHISISEPIC",1625510329
85,DreamWorks,"almost everyone's favorite is Shrek 2 .
but I like Shrek better because it's perfect",1625480335

87,DreamWorks,"The first one because it‚Äôs the og.

Fun fact: Shrek the Third premiered a year after my birthday.",1625471145
88,DreamWorks,"Practically nobody bought them, so they don't make them anymore",1625405511
89,DreamWorks,They stopped making them in 2017,1625399371
90,DreamWorks,Don't they not make 3D TVs anymore?,1625389473
91,DreamWorks,"yes ,its original netflix show",1625337534
92,DreamWorks,Obviously you aren‚Äôt talking about my country,1625245003
93,DreamWorks,One of DreamWorks most underrated movies.,1625243566
94,DreamWorks,Is HTTYD: Race to the Edge still there? I‚Äôve been looking to rewatch it,1625238095
95,DreamWorks,Ahhh! Yes!!,1625173514
96,DreamWorks,Same.,1625170663
97,DreamWorks,The best one imo,1625170196
98,DreamWorks,Ah yes the beauty of dreamworks. My favorite films are Shrek Shrek two kung fu panda monsters versus aliens how to train your Dragon Megamind kung fu panda two the Croods turbo Mr. Peabody and Sherman how to train your Dragon two home kung fu panda free throws captain underpants how to train your Dragon the hidden world,1625159466
99,DreamWorks,I have the same opinion,1625087147
0,DreamWorks,"Captain Underpants, but I would also love to see a Mr. Peabody and Sherman sequel and an Abominable sequel",1625087060
1,DreamWorks,I think you mean music man,1625082663
2,DreamWorks,"Idk about you guys, but imo, shrek was far superior to shrek.",1625006162
3,DreamWorks,Captain underpants because I think it would do the best considering theres actual sequel potential because it‚Äôs a comic book. Please don‚Äôt let them ruin Peabody and Sherman with a sequel. I‚Äôm begging you.,1625006071
4,DreamWorks,"Yes it was there only direct to video movie if you don‚Äôt count the upcoming troll: tales of Arcadia coming to Netflix. Though since both are direct to video, I didn‚Äôt include it.",1624978175
5,DreamWorks,There was also Joseph: King of Dreams but that was only a direct to video film. Pretty sure their only direct to video film too.,1624973927
6,DreamWorks,"Home was pretty great, underrated movie",1624968245
7,DreamWorks,That was by O Entertainment.,1624940345

11,DreamWorks,Where‚Äôs all of the above. I can‚Äôt pick. Seriously these movies would have been as good as Pixar and Sony. Instead DreamWorks is losing there edge. Still rooting for them!,1624928795
12,DreamWorks,Yes! I admire and respect her so much!,1624917952

17,DreamWorks,Bee Movie. Maybe have a story on other insects in addition. Maybe have a connection with Antz,1624753357
18,DreamWorks,"Captain Underpants is the one that would most benefit from a follow up, with Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman being my second choice.

Abominable was just okay so while I wouldn't mind a sequel, it's not something I'd be rushing to see.

I'm really glad that Turbo and Home don't have follow ups. I find both films really annoying.",1624735683
19,DreamWorks,Shrek The Third so overhated.,1624704269
20,DreamWorks,"How to Train Your Dragon 2. Yup, that's my favorite one, don't hate me. Also I might get death threats for this one, but as a writer, Shrek the Third is the best written shrek movie. It's my favorite",1624664592

22,DreamWorks,Glad we have the same thoughts!,1624606448

24,DreamWorks,One of my childhood favorites. Still have the VHS of this one.,1624581758

26,DreamWorks,is that Shrek 5 or something,1624540753
27,DreamWorks,Sooo funny!,1624507255
28,DreamWorks,All three films were funny and entertaining.,1624482037
29,DreamWorks,Gina Rodriguez could also be great,1624479121
30,DreamWorks,Mr. you have serious guts to say wut you think the best DreamWorks movie is what many people say is trash,1624467154
31,DreamWorks,What a coincidence.  I was just watching that last night.,1624463727
32,DreamWorks,All classics‚Ä¶ except the middle one which si still decent-ish,1624414948
33,DreamWorks,well Dalia Hern√°ndez obviously,1624409102
34,DreamWorks,Beautiful!,1624395712

37,DreamWorks,"I'm just saying the way you're wording it makes it sound like you're trying to impersonate him. Now after a while, I now know you're not really copying him, but I'm just saying you're ranking sounds to similar to his.

39,DreamWorks,"People can have the same opinions as others, you know.",1624383471
40,DreamWorks,"I agree with your opinions, in all the Disney animated movies all the villains are kind of similar and one of the worst parts we don't see their back stories. One of the most important parts of a villain is their back story, they didn't start out being bad usually there's a reason they went to the dark side. And more often DW shows their villains' backstories, examples include every villain in the Kung Fu Panda film series, Dave from Penguins of Madagascar, and Francis E. Francis from Boss Baby. DW does more work with their villains and that just a fact.",1624378652
41,DreamWorks,"Thanks \~ It was actually the style I picked for the contest, since it was draw your favorite characters from DW in anime \~",1624374961
42,DreamWorks,"Congratulations! Your art is really cute, reminds me of studio ghibli",1624368096
43,DreamWorks,classic Disney villains are generally one dimensional but better than most of the DreamWorks villains and Pixar villains are not that much of a villain. Disney twist villains almost suck.but DreamWorks lord Shane and farquaad and ramses and that guy from road to El dorado are better than any of villains from Disney,1624366217
44,DreamWorks,"Shrek 1 is trully a classic, and more funny then Forever After, but FA is a ton more emoticional, the animation is a lot better, the villain is more enjoyable

Shrek losing everthing, his swamp, his family, his wife, his friends, seeing he crying for the first time in... well, ever, it was just, dark

(I was watching Loki and Looking out for a hero just started playing while i was writing this, what are the odds)",1624223354
45,DreamWorks,why?,1624222995
46,DreamWorks,A bunch of hero's (in this case monsters) are banded together by the government to form a team with unique abilities to take down an invading alien force.,1624222958
47,DreamWorks,"Vincent The Bear was an awesome villain in particular. He was mean, selfish and untrustworthy enough to fit to trope, threatening enough to cause the conflict and had a memorable goal of using his intimidation to get food using an Ex friend raccoon.",1624220341
48,DreamWorks,The verminator alone is over powered,1624202578
49,DreamWorks,"Honestly, in my opinion, I believe that many of Disney's villains are better than a majority of the DreamWorks villains. Though, that doesn't mean that each haven't made there fair share of good and bad villains. Disney went through a phase of making terrible twist villains for some time, and with DreamWorks, they actually made some compelling and threatening villains, like the Fairy god mother, Rumpelstiltskin, Tai Lung, Lord Shen, Ramses, etc. Still, they may not be as good as the villains Micheal Rat has been churning out over the past decade, but they are at least good enough to be likeable and appreciated villains.",1624193376

59,DreamWorks,Now I'm 13,1624131179
60,DreamWorks,I was 7 when she got me the plush,1624131141
61,DreamWorks,"My mother got me the plush when I started watching the movie (you know the one I'm talking about) 10 times one night,
So she got me a plush from a website I don't know about. She never told me and I'm not gonna ask.
I knew that the captain Underpants series had gone threw 3 phases phase 1 was every book until the bionic booger boy.
Phase 2 was every book before the movie. Phase 3 was the movie redesigns
Technically there's a 4th Phase which is the Netflix exclusive mini series and main series. As well as the movies
Differences are
In Phase 1 every character had lines for eyes which were very short.
A lot of the time in Phase 1 they had these miniature Cs around there mouths 
Phase 2 was the designs which stuck until 2017 they had long lines for eyes = ^ )
And the kids didn't have the Cs anymore.
Phase 3 had eyes that were miniature circles. 0_0
Colored in black as well as 3D but the designs stick
Then the cartoon maintains the style but 2D also Melvins plain shirt with a bow tie combo was changed in the movie with a sweater vest and yellow bow tie
But the cartoon depicts the original design.",1624131118
62,DreamWorks,Furthermore this is not a cheap edit. Like some people might say I'm not fantasizing ok?,1624130533
63,DreamWorks,And neither scholastic has been involved,1624130481

71,DreamWorks,"Now that the superhero genre has changed and grown so much, I would really like to see a sequal discussing our heroes of today with a Megamind 2.

With Rise of the Guardians, I'd prefer a series where they take things like pitches backstory, mother nature, mother goose and other things and adapt them. I'd especially like a sequal where they bring up Nightlight as he's the reason Pitch is on Earth in the books as he was the one who originally defeated him.

Why did dreamworks throw away these great films but make sequals to Trolls and the Boss Baby?! ü§¢",1623952414
72,DreamWorks,I think it would be considered a song done by both the hero and the villain. It's not from the villains yet it isn't from the heroes it's kind of a compromise.,1623948118
73,DreamWorks,The reason that the boss baby got a sequel is only because the fans wanted more of it. Why they cancelled all the other ones I haven't a clue.,1623948023
74,DreamWorks,"Frankly another couple of films I'd like to see are the Penguins of Madagascar, because the film itself was very entertaining and Dave the octopus had a really interesting back story and it was like a darker Madagascar film. Another film would be Captain Underpants, now I know Dog man is coming out, but I would like a more direct sequel to the film itself. Captain Underpants has a rich history and a lot of other villains which need to be explored more in depth such as the talking toilets, the Wicked Wedgie Woman among others, also I'd like to see George and Harold's relationship change as well. Like maybe do a sequel when they're in middle school or something and maybe they've drifted apart and now they have to come back together with Mr. Krupp to take on a new threat. Anyway that's my thought which films should get a sequel.",1623947802

42,DreamWorks,"Weren‚Äôt you the one who went unto a poll asking which of the *Trolls* films people like more, just to comment about how much you hate it? The poll was NEVER meant for you. It was meant for who like at least ONE of the films. If I compare *Trolls* to *Shrek*, it‚Äôs because I love both of them. Not trying to downplay how great *Shrek* is, AT ALL!",1623463396
43,DreamWorks,It's because I absolutely despise Trolls. Let's just end this argument with a draw because it's getting too long.,1623463175
44,DreamWorks,"*Trolls* was NOT aiming to be like *Shrek*. Why do you think I was ‚Äúthrowing it under the bus‚Äù? *Trolls* as a franchise is not supposed to be like *Shrek*. If it was, it would literally just be a sequel, then. Think about it, if it was made to be like *Shrek*, then why even make a new franchise? Why not just use the same one? They owned the rights to it. They didn‚Äôt need to license it.

Also, Poppy‚Äôs quest was to save her friends. Branch came along because he genuinely cares for her. He was actively helping her. Heck, he literally managed to uplift ALL of (Pop) Trolls‚Äô spirits when all of them lost hope. The other characters literally had no idea why Branch hated singing, but you acted like they KNEW the whole time. I told you what ACTUALLY happened, and you double down by claiming it was ‚Äúpointless‚Äù.

My views on *Shrek* and *Trolls* are very positive. I love them both. And quite frankly, you seem really defensive if I even remotely compare the two franchises.",1623463029
45,DreamWorks,"1. I was making fun of Trolls by getting their names wrong because I don't give a shit.

2. Shrek went along with Donkey because he wanted his swamp back so desperately, he felt like he had no choice but to join Donkey because Donkey knows the way to Markiplier's...er...Farquaad's castle. And Donkey is the first Shrek character to not see Shrek as a monster. And when Donkey insists Shrek tell him why he's so distant from people is because people hate him, which naturally makes sense because he's an ogre. But Shrek got used to it thinking nobody could be different. So Donkey reassures Shrek that he's an ally till the end. And when Donkey comes back to the swamp to build the wall, he came back to forgive Shrek. And Shrek realizes that Donkey WAS a true friend. Shrek and Fiona getting together is done well because they find many things in common. And when Shrek sees Fiona being nice to him as well, his way of think nobody could love or even like a hideous ugly beast. Trolls just throws the killed my grandma sub plot in there just to explain why brunch won't sing and that's it. What is there to build on that? Nothing! And the movie just makes the main characters be together so it's believable to the kids because that's how it goes to them.

Don't bring Shrek into this. Don't throw him under the bus. Shrek did everything Trolls was ""striving"" to do well, and you know it.",1623462305
46,DreamWorks,"The plot forces popsicle and brunch to be a couple even though they have literally nothing in common. Every troll takes it as a personal offense that brunch refuses to sing and he's not like the others. It's completely fine to not like singing after your grandma dies from it (hahahahahahahahaha I'm sorry that plot line is stupid as hell), the moral on finding happiness within yourself is fine, but it's so cringe worthy and isn't done well at all because the plot seems to forget about it for a while and then bring it back to get the burgers on the trolls side at the end.",1623460717
47,DreamWorks,Care to elaborate?,1623459956
48,DreamWorks,But does it do it PROPERLY? Nope! It does it because the plot calls for it.,1623459842
49,DreamWorks,"But seriously, look at ALL the other ACTUAL  DreamWorks movies I listed and their themes. Shrek is finding identity and self-worth, Kung Fu Panda is finding inner peace with your losses and going forward in life with things that make you special, How to Train your Dragon is making friends and eventually letting them go when the time comes, The Prince of Egypt is staying what you are or finding out what you could be. None of this could EVER come out of a Trolls movie properly if at all.",1623459389
50,DreamWorks,Alright.,1623458957

53,DreamWorks,"You know what? That sounds like a good idea. But the movie doesn't get off Scott free because of how infuriating it is because DreamWorks made a PLETHORA of more mature, more entertaining, and less triggering films aimed at EVERYONE. Trolls is made for literal infants and nobody else. At least it's not Cars 2. Even though they're basically on the same level of quality.",1623458513
54,DreamWorks,[deleted],1623458065
55,DreamWorks,"I don't care. My point is, I like the older DreamWorks. When they didn't make movies for the money only. If you like trolls, that's great. All power to you. I don't.

The Prince of Egypt, Spirit,  Shrek (minus the third one), Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train your Dragon were made for the art first, and the money second. MODERN DreamWorks movies I.E. Trolls, Boss Baby, Croods, Home, was the opposite. Made for the money first, and the art second. But those movies are so bad you know they weren't even made for sake of it. Older DreamWorks was because they wanted to make them. Kinda like how Walt Disney said himself: ""We don't make movies for the money, we make money for the movies."" Of course, neither Disney or DreamWorks follow that anymore with Disney and their remakes, and DreamWorks with their Trolls and Boss Babies.",1623456944

61,DreamWorks,[deleted],1623455334
62,DreamWorks,"The main points of the movie are 2:

1) Hiccup being able to be independent, the dragon riders rely too much on their and not enough on each other. Hiccup thinks that he is nothing without toothless. It's about them learning to ""not need"" the dragons.

2) hiccup and toothless loving each other enough to let each other go. If you love someone to the point that you would sacrifice yourslef to save him, and you want to stay with him, what would you do if you know that staying with you is bad for him? Would you let him go because you love him and you want to put his wellbeing before your happiness? Or would you be selfish and force him to stay with you, harming him, because you want him?


It's not hiccup abandoning toothless because he doesn't want to struggle to protect him, he lets him go because it's best for toothless and he wants the best for him. As chief he has the responsibility to do the best for the people of berk, and toothless as alpha has the responsibility to do the best for the dragons, and staying together because They enjoy each other's company would be bad for all of them, hiccup, his people, toothless, and the dragons.it would put in danger all of them, This way the people of berk are safe from the people Who hate dragons, and dragons are safe too, because nobody else can hurt them in the hidden world. He is not doing it for himself, he is doing it for toothless, the dragons, people of berk, and his father, who wanted the best for the people of berk, and wanted his son to protect them.",1623441174

11,DreamWorks,Thank you \^\^,1623105732
12,DreamWorks,"I didn't think about that regarding the third film. I just thought that the third tried way too hard to lean towards comedy, and as a result the script suffered and many of the jokes fell short. 

There's this one thing I learned from Filmento, where if your villain is not personally connected with your main character, your story is going to be compelling because if your villain is personally a ""villain"" to your protagonist, there is no possible way the story can end without a final confrontation between the two. It doesn't even necessarily have to be a physical fight, just something that acknowledges that your main protagonist has moved past what he could have became if he went down the villain's path. 

And Kai was not connected to Po at all. Anyone could have defeated him and the story would stay the same. If someone punches you or someone you love, that fight is going to mean a lot more because that person made it personal. But, if someone punches a stranger, sure, you're helping someone by protecting them, but it's not compelling because anyone could have done that.

Here's the video in question: https://youtu.be/L8_h0Fhr0LA",1623093712
13,DreamWorks,"Exactly, both extremely well written characters that are arguably two of the greatest animated villains of all time. The villains of KFP have always been a reflection of what Po could have become if he hadn't of learned the lessons he did. He learnt that the power came from believing in himself, something Tai Lung couldnt do, and he learnt to let go, which is something shen could not do. 

Its also why i consider Kai one of the weaker villains, he isn't that direct comparison like the other two are, he is more a comparison of oogway and as a result the third film suffers",1623087930
14,DreamWorks,I completely agree! Both awesome films.,1623087600

Now that I think about it, I do think Tai Lung is much more relatable. It's hard to compare yourself with someone who slaughtered an entire village.

Tai Lung was fed lies about becoming The Dragon Warrior just because Shifu wanted him to be. When Oogway rejected Tai Lung, Tai channeled his anger into getting vengeance against Shifu for wronging him, but the truth is, a scroll or a secret ingredient is not what makes us special. The only thing that makes us special is our actions. What happened in the past doesn't define us because we change over time. 

I feel like with Shen, you're left feeling sorry for him, but your disgust for his actions outweighs any relatability. Kind of like with Irena from Cat People (1942), or Arthur from Joker.

But with Tai Lung, you still feel appalled by his actions, but you can still relate to them and many of us have likely been in similar situations where we stay resentful instead of taking time to forgive and find ourselves.",1623082670
18,DreamWorks,Looks great!,1623081474
19,DreamWorks,I still think it‚Äôs great even after your analysis but I understand we‚Äôre your coming from,1623081471
20,DreamWorks,"Like I said, its over rated due to nostalgia, the actual movie is too fast paced the villains aren't really expanded upon much and the ending feels predictable and anti-climatic. Great film! But over rated due to nostalgia",1623081395
21,DreamWorks,"He certainly is very compelling. For me however I didn't relate to him because while his need for attention is compelling, slaughtering a village of panda's borders psychotic mental disorder. Which I cannot relate too. It makes him a great and unique villain for sure, but not as relatable for me at least.

The reason I think Ti Lung is a great compelling villain is because he is in a sense justified in his actions. He is trained and fed lies about becoming the greatest and most powerful warrior is to the point that becoming the dragon warrior wasnt about being a good person but rather power or anger towards his master. A message that can be translated very easily into everyday people with normal lives.

I also think he holds an important message to not be resentful. While his initial actions in trying to steal the scroll could be justified, he wasted the years he spent in prison to reflect on his actions and improve as a person. Due to the resentment and anger he held and refused to let go of, he made the same mistakes over and over. Something that again, a lot of people now a days do too often.",1623079014

24,DreamWorks,"Ah, I get it. I rank films based on personal enjoyment as well rather than their ""objective score"". I related to Shen more personally because all he ever wanted to do was impress his parents and when the only people he ever looked up to rejected him, he felt so much agony that he never wanted to feel the pain of feeling inferior ever again.

Notice how whenever he's in a battle with someone, whenever his enemy obtains a slight advantage, he just immediately flees to his weapon. He's so afraid of feeling lesser than someone else that he invented a weapon to help him conquer China so nobody else could challenge him, meaning he'd never have to feel inferior ever again. 

It's even more genius when you consider that he's an White Peacock. Not only does he thrive off of attention to a toxic level, but I have a theory that because of his color (race), he was ostracized by the other Peacocks, thus, he wanted to show the world that he existed. 

When you value attention too much, you lose sight of what's important. Maybe if he actually had a friend in his early years he wouldn't have developed such a toxic inferiority complex. I think we totally deserve at least a short film explaining Shen's upbringing",1623076282
25,DreamWorks,"Shrek 1 and 2 are great. However I think their scores and cinematography fall flat when compared to HTTYD 1, KFP 1 and Prince of Egypt so that is why they are not up the top",1623076019

Plus Kai was the worst villain of the three, still great, just not as good as the other two",1623075918
27,DreamWorks,"&gt;The reason I put Kung fu panda 2 lower isnt necessarily because its worse however I think Tai lung was a more relatable villain for me personally. Also I think the second one, while incredible, doesnt expand enough from the first one to be Oscar Worthy, its a similar score with similar themes and the side characters become annoying, bit like in HTTYD. One of my favourites but not oscar worthy tier personally.",1623075818

35,DreamWorks,"Tough pick as I love both Trolls movies equally. Loved Trolls story about finding happiness, and World Tour's exciting adventure. Each movie has their moments that made me laugh and even tear up.

My vote goes for Trolls, mostly because the movie and its characters cheered me up after going through one of the hardest years of my life years ago. Really a comforting movie for me.

I do love both movies, and consider them some of my all-time favorite movies.",1622468050

59,DreamWorks,"ummmm, haven't heard of it, sorry",1622318284
60,DreamWorks,why not Spirit? As far as I'm concerned it is better than Sinbad and the Road to El Darado,1622318170
61,DreamWorks,Kai? Really Kai is a remarkable villain and even succeeded in capturing Oogway and he is actually kind of funny,1622318055
62,DreamWorks,I could be mistaken but shouldn't Joseph King of Dreams be on this list too?,1622275344
63,DreamWorks,"Road to El Dorado was beautifully illustrated and there were such dynamic scenes. Everything flowed really well. The music was incredible too.

Prince of Egypt was also beautiful, also had beautiful music, but I do favor Road to El Dorado",1622264331
64,DreamWorks,I watch it during the Christmas season nearly every year and im still holding out hope for a sequel to be announced. We get a remake/sequel for lord knows how many movies why not this one? Dreamworks do ya hear me *shakes fist*,1622252910
65,DreamWorks,"I've always wanted a sequel for RoTG as well or a tv series might work as well since I know that William Joyce is still on-board for anything to happen with his IP and he's given them enough material for Dreamworks to expand on it. 

It is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen (it released on my birthday back in 2012) and I've always wanted Dreamworks to develop it further in some way. The only problem is that it suffered at the big office and though I think the fanbase would still be interested in something like a tv series or something else, but Dreamworks might still be hesitant to do anything because (from their point of view) it wasn't received well enough back when it first released which is a huge shame. :/",1622250561
66,DreamWorks,All except Spirit.,1622244178
67,DreamWorks,I would honestly prefer a franchise because one of their best elements is their visuals and I feel like the magic works best with the movie team,1622242887
68,DreamWorks,What about a TV Series?,1622241925
69,DreamWorks,I love that movie. Realllly wish they made a sequel or a animated series of it.,1622237996
70,DreamWorks,"I definitely agree, Dreamworks usually makes quality sequels (HTTYD, Shrek, KFP). I think the movie critically too is underrated. I remember seeing it as a kid 10 years ago and that charm is still there for me",1622236481

81,DreamWorks,"Long story short, TrollHunters' animation art style character designs are very similar to HTTYD but yeah, despite the differences with the book, HTTYD was one DreamWorks best franchises and the fact it was animated was better because if it was animated, it'll end up looking like the dumbest on screen with those costumes, hair and makeup and what not and plus, they'll make Toothless look so realistic, he might end up looking creepy than cute.

Just like HTTYD, Percy Jackson is full of monsters as well but because it won't be animated, they'll end up looking like crap and same with the costumes. In fact, in live action, seeing a bunch if kids in those orange Camp Half-Blood shirts will look more like a Rick Riordan fan gathering rather than characters in a show. Same with their battle armor. It just won't work",1622150411

84,DreamWorks,Oh I could definitely see it working in the How to Train Your Dragon animation style (can't comment on TrollHunters since I've never watched that). Especially since How to Train Your Dragon was similarly adapted from a YA series.,1622150016
85,DreamWorks,"Yup. I imagine it would've looked beautiful in 3D as well like how they did How to Train your Dragon or TrollHunters but no, they're gonna be stuck with Disney and end up as live-action slop",1622148232

21,DreamWorks,"Oh definitely. Along with the godawful live-action, the writing of Artemis Fowl was a joke and how they adapted the characters was beyond idiotic. It was nothing like the original source material and one person in the YouTube comments of the trailer even said that they managed to turn Artemis Fowl into a Spy Kids knock-off. After seeing the movie, I agree.

Also, I said it was an obsession as Disney has been making lots live-action stuff lately, from their remakes to their Disney+ content",1621828474
22,DreamWorks,"I really don't think it's an obsession, the natural default for any franchise will always be live action. The biggest problem with most failed YA books is always the writing, rarely the effects.",1621827469
23,DreamWorks,I totally agree! Bad call! It makes me not as interested in watching the movie it just won‚Äôt be the same! Everything is all about money. You have high end actors voicing then they think it brings more money in.  I wish the movie would just be on Netflix‚Äôs.,1621799990

I also appreciate how they manage to adapt books into animated franchises well, like Shrek, How To Train your Dragon, Captain Underpants, and TrollHunters. I believe that by how they turn books into animated movies and shows, it translates them better than live action which is why I'm disappointed Disney doesn't do that and instead, turned Artemis Fowl into live-action drivel. Though, there are times where sometimes, their films can be worse than Disney, like the Boss Baby, Bee Movie and Shark Tale. Those movies were just pretty bad, in my opinion.",1621463112

The 3rd one is even worse, with a terrible ""liar revealed"" plot and being full of cringy moments and pop songs. The only good parts of the trilogy are the penguins and the two major human villians. (the crazy old lady in the first two and the crazy german cop lady in the third one) Everything else is cringe, though I really liked them as a kid for some reason.",1620830288
5,DreamWorks,"I hate quite a few actually. Boss Baby, Turbo, and Trolls are some of my least favorites, and I dislike Home, Shrek the 3rd, Shark Tale, and a couple others. I do think that Trolls 2 is overhated tho. If they didn't spam pop songs so much then it would have been an easy 7/10 movie, but since they did it's a 5/10. Trolls 1 is a 2/10 because they spammed pop songs even more than the second one and it's painfully cringy. The second one is just Infinity War but worse and with pop music.

Bee movie is also unironicly good in spite of the memes. The creativity is off the charts and the off-the-walls insanity of the plot changing gneres every 15 minutes is hallarious. First it's a coming of age story, then it's a romance, then it becomes a lawyer movie, and finally it becomes a disaster movie in the last 10 minutes. Genius!",1620830061
6,DreamWorks,No,1620829712
7,DreamWorks,"Because it's just good. The story is simplistic and it uses the boring ""liar revealed"" and ""3rd act character tentsion"" tropes which are in literally every animated movie now and helped popularize the trend. The animation style is extremely charming, but otherwise it's a decent movie. Nothing really too special.",1620829668

10,DreamWorks,"I agree with this list for the most part, but I have a few gripes. For one, I would completely swap the placements of Dragons The Hidden World and Megamind. The latter is a masterpiece beyond words and my all-time favorite movie while in the previous only the ending reaches the highs of the first movie and the rest is just good. The dragon ""romance"" was by far the worst part. 

Also, I would put spirit a bit lower and Kung Fu Panda 2 a little higher. Otherwise I pretty much fully agree with this list. Personally, if I could rank the top 5 DreamWorks films it would be 1: Prince of Egypt 2: Megamind 3: Dragons 1 4: Shrek 2 5: Kung Fu Panda 2. 

While I personally like Megamind a bit more, I can not put Prince of Egypt any lower because it is a film so good that I can truely say that it was inspired by God himself. The animation is stunning, the songs are incredible, and the story is great and emotional. It's the greatest movie ever made. Better than Citizen Kane even. Every human being should watch The Prince of Egypt, especially Christains, (it's quite literally the best piece of christain media ever, and wasn't even made by hardcore Christains) and I'm pretty sure it's God's favorite movie too as they adapted His story so well that watching the movie is arguably SUPERIOR to reading the first half of Exodus. Imagine that, a movie made by non-christains trumping the bible and is beloved by Christains and non Christains alike. Crazy.",1620829464

It's a fine enough movie, the visuals are nice, the voice acting is fine, but the songs are fairly forgettable, the caricature is wierd.

Both ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" and ""Frozen II"" had a lot of potential and were great, at best, but weren't better or as good as their predecessors. 

Meanwhile, DreamWorks has had consistently solid sequels, such as the HTTYD sequels, KFP sequels, and of course, the Shrek sequels (excluding Shrek The Third).

The true question is not about ""how"" or ""if"" but ""when"".

(Besides, they don't actually need to go in. Getting close is enough to cause more than enough harm.)",1619718877
8,DreamWorks,"The hidden world has been found before, but give this a logical perspective. Toothless has thousands of dragons in his disposal, including some titan dragons too like Drago's. All they have are boats which will literally fall in the waterfall and they can't get up. They'll end up dying anyways. It has no way of teaching us of running and hiding from our problem. It says many times to let things go if you love them and make them happy. Hiccup lets them go because they'll be more happy at the Hidden World. Berk knows that hiding is a futile plan and they address that to Hiccup. This was their best play for both them and the dragons.

&amp;#x200B;

The difference is that humans are much more smarter creatures than dragons. Sometimes animals seem to forget each other and pets sometimes forget owners after long periods of time. If Hiccup had a completely different scent, Toothless would've killed him. He didn't recognize him from looks but smell. The dragons are essentially wild creatures and they have their primal instincts. What if they're hungry, what if they're trying to protect their young. These dragons probably never seen humans before so they won't be open to it even after adjusting because they aren't as human as humans. Even if humans and dragons forget about each other, it won't matter. The dragons are safe in their hidden world with a great ecosystem for them. They probably would fight each other if one or 2 tries to leave the cave but overall, there isn't a better ending if they stayed with the gang.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Even if they tried, there's a risk they won't listen and be enemies because of being Dragonphobic

&amp;#x200B;

Listen...how are humans supposed to get in without crashing their boat, fight thousands of dragons, prepare for thousands of dragons, go through a maze where only dragons can go through, and actually get out alive? The Hidden World seems harsh for humans from the moment they fall in.",1619716831
9,DreamWorks,"""The problem is, there's always going to be someone that hates dragons."" This is the core of the (in lore) problem. It is the reason there was so much fighting. It is the reason Berk and the dragons decided to seperate themselves from each other and go into hiding. Unfortunately it is also the reason why this plan is doomed to fail. If the world really is out to hunt the dragons as this very drastic decision implies there is no hiding. The hidden world will be found (it was found before) as well as the new location of Berk. The core of the problem remains not just unsolved but according to the movie completely unaddressed. It teaches us to run/hide from our problems but at best this hiding approach defers the inevitable fighting to a later point in time. This might work if there was an actual plan to utilize the the time they have until discovery. However the movie shows no intent for that but Berk wants to hide for good which again is futile in the long run.

""Dragons in the hidden world won't be able to coexist with the humans."" Why not? If dragons can live with humans, humans can live with dragons. The dragons might initially not like the humans but that is actually the same problem as the humans initially not liking the dragons, just the other end of it. This might give reason to an initial, temporary separation but again it ignores any long term solution. If the separation lasts too long the problem will even become worse as both humans and dragons will eventually forget about each other and Hiccup's and Toothless' efforts to help their coexistence. Back to square one; humans and dragons fight each other because they simply don't know each other.

About option 3: I meant the Berkians might have never tried to convince other humans to help in protecting the dragons.

The ""hide forever"" ending might have worked (for the dragons at least) if the hidden world was not just a literal hole somewhere in the ocean but an entirely different plane of existence that was inherently inaccessible by humans. *There* the dragons could have been *actually* safe. Thinking about it, this might essentially be what the script intended for the hidden world to be but failed at by giving it a physical location.",1619716006
10,DreamWorks,"It does not actively abandon it, it's doing what's right for them. It's not a problem of Hiccup not needing Toothless anymore, it's more of an act of keeping the dragons safe because the world won't stop hunting them. 6 years of movies and shows prove this and Berk and Dragons wouldn't have found peace otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

The justification that Toothless left was fine because since he's the king of Dragons, he can control them all and protect them from ravage dragon hunters.

&amp;#x200B;

The point was that there is no straight line in life and what are they gonna do? Fight for their entire lives. There are families to protect and dragons to prevent from going extinct. Grimmel is proof that the world will never change. And, even if it is friendship, would it be Friendship to keep your friend from being happy? Would it be friendship to keep them away from something they love? Friendship is still valid bc Hiccup cares more about what Toothless wants more than anything else. And by doing that, everyone lives in peace and is happy

&amp;#x200B;

The Book with no end can be caused with speculation but Httyd confronted this ending in a responsible and mature possible way.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, there's always going to be someone that hates dragons. In the original Httyd show, there was this old man who hated the dragons. Chances are he still does and if he was younger, he would do something about it. There won't be a future where the dragons will be always safe. There's also a Dragonphobic person out there. They have convinced other settlements that dragons are friendly, but look at Drago, he clearly wasn't up for reason. Hiccup never tries to convince Grimmel because he learned that not everyone will be convinced. Not everyone will be convinced, that's just reality Like this discussion for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: They won't live in peace and the other village would have a strong chance of breaking their alignment because at the beginning of this movie, everyone from Gobber to Valka to Astrid questioned Hiccup's choices and it shows how unorganized Berk was. Also, it was shown that dragons living in The Hidden World didn't like the humans, so hiding wouldn't have worked.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: As I said, not everyone can be convinced, Drago &amp; Grimmel is proof of this. Chances are, so are many other people

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2.5: Dragons in the hidden world won't be able to coexist with the humans, it's the whole point of that escape sequence. And even if Toothless can control them. That's called force and he's not letting them live peacefully or happy. That was shown when Drago's Bewilderbeast attacked.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: They did save the dragons. They kept them safe and transported them to a safe haven where no one will try to attempt to find them.

&amp;#x200B;

I get your point about the Overcrowding of Berk. The choice for that is to show Hiccup's questionable choices and build him to show more empathy for both sides rather than just the dragons. Also, literally, the other dragons CAN'T unfollow Toothless, which was shown with Drago's Bewilderbeast attempt. Maybe a few got loose and if that's the case, it just proves why the humans can't live with the dragons. Also, I'm pretty sure there's one alpha dragon for the whole world considering how there are a few Bewilderbeasts around for they're not endangered, but a threatened species. Toothless isn't trying to control the dragons, but more to keep them safe and in his empire under his own protection. He's not like the Bewilderbeast who is supposed to represent dictatorship but more of a free will leader. They don't reject help and I agree with you that other lost dragons in cages are a bad writing point, but that's only it really.

&amp;#x200B;

The end is justified because it grows on the growth of others and helps them mature as characters. It gives them a stronger heart and peace at knowing their loved ones are safer now and that this is the best possible ending. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ending you gave would be happier, but it doesn't resemble humanity as much. This ending is satisfying and amazing due to how it gives a mature ending without setting up new movies and peace to all sides important.

&amp;#x200B;

I do enjoy having this discussion though.",1619706858
11,DreamWorks,"Agreed, the third movie ended on a bad note. I would love to see a happy end or at least a more reasonable one.

Also, Berk and the dragons can't hide forever. They *will* get found eventually. What will happen then?",1619701214
12,DreamWorks,"The moral of ""if you love it, learn to let it go"" may be a good one but the movie plays it out as ""if you love it, actively abandon it to prove that you can exist without it"". Beeing a good person even without your friends can be means to acceptance but can never be justification to send them away (""I don't need you that's why I want you to go away."").

It also throws me off that no one seems to be bothered by this but Hiccup and Toothless. Toothless actually has the best reasons to leave as he has the responsibility of the alpha dragon and he is about to found a family. They could have focused on this to built the same moral with a much better justification.

The first two movies were like ""Friendship will overcome anything."" then the third one just sais ""F\*\*\* that. Bullies gonna bully. Friendship isn't worth the effort. Better hide until all the bullies in the world stop existing. (AKA 'forever')"".

""We can't have a book with no end"" is like saying ""water is wet"" but just because it will end doesn't mean it needs a poorly written ending. (As an unrelated side note, 'open ends' are also a thing. Not everything has to 'go out with a bang'.)

No neighboring villages? No traders? No allies? No enemies? If there was literally no one else around they shouldn't need to worry about getting attacked. However if the big bad evil guys can conjure up whole armadas there clearly must be *someone*. Besides, Hiccup and his friends have been actively searching for and rescuing dragons (usually from other humans). That proves that there are both other humans and other dragons within reach. Do you think they never tried to convince other settlements that dragons can be friendly?

Option 1: They did and they succeded. They have allies and are no longer a single village against the world. No need to hide. (If they actually need to hide the other villages need to hide too, btw.)

Option 2: They did and they failed. They should continue. If Berk, a village full of dragon slayers, can be convinced others can be too.

Option 2.5: They contacted every other human on the planet and failed ultimately. Everone but Berk hates dragons and will never accept their friendship. WTF. Vanish from the world like the dragons. Move *with them* to the hidden world. Pray for a long time until you are found. (Spoilers: You will be found.)

Option 3: They never tried. Why the heck not? About time they started! I thought saving dragons is what Berk was about?!

This leads to the next issue. The Berkians were saving other dragons. This had caused the overcrowding at the beginning of the third movie. (Why does every dragon even have to live in Berk in the first place?) When they abandon the Berkian dragons to the hidden world they also abandon all other dragons still in need of rescuing. But the movie's script completely forgets about them. Toothless may be the alpha that can command other dragons but what about those who simply cannot follow? What is even the maximum broadcast distance of the alpha's contol? The entire world? Do other alphas  exist in other groups of dragons? If so it renders the 'Berkian maneuver' to be completely pointless and it skewes the moral even more; ""let your life be controlled by bullies AND reject help to those who still need it"".

A tragic ending to a story is generally acceptable and the intended morals around coming of age, letting go and acceptance are good ones. Unfortunately the movie feels like it was forced to end this way because this end cannot be justified without ignoring some important aspects and having characters act out-of-character.

Oh my goodnes, what a wall of text...",1619700764
13,DreamWorks,My bad i left out a 'c'. Acknowledge. Maybe there're more typos or grammatical errors. I wasn't in my clearest state at the time when i wrote this.,1619668775
14,DreamWorks,"For your first point, the moral is if you love something, you should learn to let it go and not let it taint who you are

&amp;#x200B;

Hiccup thinks that it's the best decision because he's lived 6 years where there will always be someone who will try to murder these dragons. Drago, the characters from the show, and Grimmel. He also sees that Toothless and other dragons are living the times of their lives there happy. Toothless never think to come back because he's finally at peace. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there were neighboring villages, Hiccup would've known and tried to talk to them about it. It's supposed to symbolize and foreshadow the change Hiccup and Berk goes through in the story. They let the dragons go because it symbolizes change and that they need a better solution than just running away sometimes. The dragons have the chance to move too, but will they truly be happy? No, they hate fighting these hunters and warmongers. Everyone wants peace, and it's only peaceful when they go back to The Hidden World.

&amp;#x200B;

The first concept is still really strong in this movie. It's Hiccup's concern for the dragons is why they let them go. It's compassion and care that make him do this decision. Also, this movie isn't bad because it's about the maturity and growth of these characters.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like you're only mad because of its endings. No, it had a consistent story that built upon the first 2 movies. It had engaging worldbuilding by Grimmel's Armada and the Hidden World.

&amp;#x200B;

And the message at the end where if you love something, you should let it go if it means they will be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I LOVE this movie for what it did. It showed a mature concept where if you let things go for the better, they will have a better life.

&amp;#x200B;

Hiccup realizes that he's always been a great person without Toothless and becomes a great chief and father

&amp;#x200B;

Toothless helped figure out the Alpha who he was and finally found peace and settled down with The Light Fury and 3 baby dragons.

&amp;#x200B;

And the lesson still goes on because Hiccup says that the dragons will come out when Humans will learn to coexist with them. For kids, that means that they will eventually come back, but for us adults, there will always be someone that will hate dragons and that their lives are better off without them and that they should be at peace for where they are.

&amp;#x200B;

They didn't throw that all away. We still have these world-building arcs. We still have these stories. It's just that we can't have a book with no end. This was the final page in the final chapter of How to Train your Dragon.",1619666873
15,DreamWorks,"""What makes it not good?""

I appologize in advance if I come off as rude but the third movie is such a sore point for me. The way the ending was played out just makes me sad and angry every time I think about it.

Four reasons why I wouldn't exactly call this conclusion ""perfect"":

I wholeheartedly *dis*agree with the moral of the story. Your friends get bullied and you get bullied for being friends with them. Solution: Abandon them in a hole and never see them again.

Moving the village and abandoning the dragons is illogical for several reasons. (Is this even effective? What about neighboring villages? I can actually think of better solutions.) Just ask if you want me to go into detail.

The ending feels rushed. Moving Berk and letting go of the dragons are both massive events that no one seems to be very concerned about. ""Let's go!"" - ""Goodbye!"" - The end.

What pains me the most is this: Friendship between humans and dragons is my most favorite story concept. The first movie was so good in that regard; let go of prejudices, dare to show compassion and build a strong friendship. A world where this is possible was introduced. The second movie and the Riders of Berk series expand on that. The third one however strait up ends it all by effectively removing dragons and any form of contact with them from the series entirely. To make things worse they didn't just make a bad movie, this movie destroyed what the first two built up. Even worse, they even call it the final movie which kills all hope for a potential recovery.

I was so hyped to finally see the third movie but it left me completely devastated. We had a near perfect first movie with a good second one and then number three just ruins everything for me. I think I would be happier if I had never watched it. :(",1619665046

57,DreamWorks,"#Kung Fu Panda 3 is the best in the franchise. In Kung Fu Panda 2 (the favorite of most people), Lord Shen attacked the panda village, but there was nobody to save them. In Kung Fu Panda 3, Kai attacks the village and Po has to save them. You cannot say that's not the most beautiful thing. It's genius. I really thought the action and comedy was the best in this movie too. When Po gave Kai the chi, he didn't exactly give it to Kai. He gave it to the masters that he took the chi from. That's why he yelled ""Wait, that's too much!"" Also, at the beginning, Oogway told Kai ""The more you take, the less you have."" Then what happens? Kai dies from taking too much. Also, Po was taught Kung Fu with food. Then he taught the village of pandas with their talents. The whole ""turn you into you"" thing wasn't a callback to the beginning of the movie, it was a callback to Kung Fu Panda 1. Most people like Shen the most, but Kai is actually the best villain. He may not have been intimidating, but he had really great villain lines. When Shifu said ""Oogway, forgive me."" Kai held up the chi of Oogway and said ""What do you say, Oogway? Do you forgive him?"" Also, his music was obviously the best villain music in existence. I don't need to talk about comedy, action, or animation. Everyone already agrees that comedy, action, and animation in Kung Fu Panda 3 is better than the first two movies. A lot of people complain that the Furious Five didn't do much but I think I need to remind people that this movie is in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. Not ""The Adventures of the Furious Five"", because Po is one of the most entertaining main characters from any movies. I don't get how people think this is the worst or second best in the franchise. I think it's better than Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2 combined.",1618413928

I honestly should get around to watching itüòÖ",1616989498
21,DreamWorks,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs super underrated, but as my personal favorite, I feel it doesn‚Äôt get nearly as much recognition as it deserves.  Also, as a side note, I have never seen Prince of Egypt, and as such, whenever someone mentions it, I pretend I‚Äôve never heard of it.  It‚Äôs fun to see how people react to that.",1616988011
22,DreamWorks,"But is it that underrated? I see it critically praised as a masterpiece right up there with Prince of Egypt. 

I also love Spirit, but from what I've seen of DW fans I don't think it's one of the most underrated.",1616987766
23,DreamWorks,"I‚Äôm gonna stop you right there.  Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is THE **greatest** DW movie.  A masterpiece.  An absolutely stunning work of art.  Fight me.  I loved Mr. Peabody and Sherman, I enjoyed The Croods, but nothing, not even HTTYD, Shrek or KFP can top Spirit.

Also when it comes to powers we don't know much about them. The lack of background makes it hard to know how they are feeling just before the meteor. The heat coming from the meteor wouldn't kill Octavia as they are a hell creature but the velocity of it will which would make Stolas very sad.

However, with both of those trilogies completed, they feel they have to milk some of their less successful properties like Trolls or The Boss Baby, but I have faith they'll eventually get back up on their feet and make movies with the same level of quality as their late 00s/early 10s golden age.",1613169782

I mean to each his own, but Madagascar is also a DreamWorks classic so I feel like they should really be on here either way, especially before Captain Underpants.

In my opinion the Trolls movies are also missing from this flowchart (they have a lot of heart and a truly great story, plus the worldbuilding is pretty incredible) but along with the third Shrek movie I know that those are severely underrated overall, so I wasn't really expecting them here in the first place.",1612144023

These are all things that HTTYD, KFP, and 75% of the Shrek films have. (shrek the third doesn‚Äôt exist)

77,DreamWorks,"Probably DW's most underrated movie, ever. Like it's amazing but no one ever gives it credit smh",1611965072
78,DreamWorks,"This is a pretty solid list I just disagree on 3 things:

1) Why does everyone put Home so low. It's literally the most mediocre movie on earth. Like it's not great but it's harmless fun. 

2) Peabody is NOT mediocre. It's literally amazing and one of their most creative movies. So, so underrated by DW fans.

3. Monsters VS Aliens??!? AWFUL??? IMMA THROW HANDS

but otherwise, pretty solid list",1611965007

97,DreamWorks,"I 100% agree, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is one of my favorite Dreamworks films ever, it‚Äôs even in my TOP 3 Dreamworks animated films. I love everything about the movie, the cinematography, the score, the animation, the message, the story, the romance, the friendship, and everything in between. The Show however is complete garbage!!!! I have not seen the show and why should I when it , like you said, doesn‚Äôt acknowledge the tone, message or story of the original film. Its not even a proper follow up to the film. It‚Äôs a shamed Spirit is one of the most underrated Dreamworks films ever but I‚Äôm happy some people acknowledge the film for what it is and how amazing it is. I hope dreamworks could open the eyes and make a true follow up sequel  the film. Which would make us Spirit fans happy. Nuff said.",1611891412

12,DreamWorks,"I would put king fu panda in the ""great"" tier, its comedy is sometimes either boring, cringe or out of place but it still compliments the other movies and po, with him actually finding out who he is and finishing the kung fu panda series.

25,DreamWorks,Eh. You know what. I agree. Especially with KFP. I love those movies. My favorite movies. But I do agree that 3 wasn‚Äôt as good as 1&amp;2. But I will say I did enjoy 3 more than 2. Shen just wasn‚Äôt that interesting to me.,1610928530

45,DreamWorks,"Indeed it was, glad they left the franchise with something was actually good. Imagine if Shrek the Third was the last Shrek movie , don't think that the Shrek franchise would get praised that much, and Kungfu Panda would easily be the the better trilogy.",1610458896
46,DreamWorks,oh shit you right that‚Äôs a very good underrated movie,1610458530

61,DreamWorks,what do u mean Hans Christian Anderson i never heard of him,1610272167
62,DreamWorks,Better let Hans Christian Anderson know,1610271639
63,DreamWorks,"World building. The worlds of HTTYD, Shrek, &amp; Kung Fu Panda are far more well fleshed out &amp; interesting than any of the worlds Pixar has ever made.

Even some of their one off films like ‚ÄúRise of the Guardian‚Äù have really neat worlds.",1610252913
64,DreamWorks,**How to Train Your Dragon**. Enough said.,1610245720
65,DreamWorks,I prefer when he did YTPs tbh,1610239613

73,DreamWorks,"So much was said, with so few words.  Absolutely phenomenal.",1610165527
74,DreamWorks,That film is criminally underrated. I think the decision to make Spirit a non-speaking character was such an outstanding decision.,1610162551

20,DreamWorks,"I feel Shrek and Kung Fu Panda would make a killer crossover. Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar should also happen.

Considering Dragon is a member of the Shrek franchise, then Shrek would do pretty well with HTTYD as a crossover.

Idk, this is just how I feel.",1609551691
21,DreamWorks,don't forget Tai lung too lol,1609540513
22,DreamWorks,"No. It‚Äôs worse. He‚Äôs had his entire life to meditate in his isolated location, only sipping on melted snow as sustenance for 20 years",1609466871

26,DreamWorks,"As someone mentioned, they were gonna make sequels but it was released at the same time as other films, though, not Harry Potter, as well as the marketing was a joke that caused it to be a financial flop and even if it was by mistake, Jeffrey probably didn't care because how the kiddy stuff made him lots of money and given how he was kicking stuff like Larrikens and Mumbai Musical to the curb, I felt that he was really DreamWorks' worst enemy and he only saw animation as a way to get richer",1609445348
27,DreamWorks,"Which I bet, that even if it was unintentional, it still showed how idiotic and shortsighted Jeffrey Katzenberg was and the fact years after RotG, DreamWorks kept pumping out more kiddy junk under his watch like Turbo, Home, Boss Baby, Mr. Peabody and Sherman and Penguins of Madagascar, just made things worse. It gave me the idea that if it's not HTTYD nor Kung Fu Panda, no other ideas that aren't kiddy stuff won't survive. Also, like RotG, the latter two movies I mentioned were box office failures as well",1609444840
28,DreamWorks,I'm an animation student and one of my professors was part of the project management members of that film. They planned on making a film for each guardian making that one the protagonist.

One artist who worked on the film actually came to my high school to talk during a career thingy and expressed, from what I remember, how they had high hopes for the film but it didnt do well.

35,DreamWorks,"I feel the same for Rise of the Guardians and Megamind, as both had potential to be big franchises but I guess Jeffrey Katzenberg thought they were useless pikes of junk and left them to die prematurely",1609373746
36,DreamWorks,Yes. I don‚Äôt think it deserves the bad rap that it gets.,1609369895

73,DreamWorks,Okay,1608780240
74,DreamWorks,"my take on the last jedi is that many things and tros were screwed over because of how lame the first movie is, tfa. not a new hope or the phantom menace, they are not lame but still do have some famous problems. anyway, luke had to be mean because he had to have a reason to be away in the first place, whether if people liked it or not. and thats something jj did, not rian. some things like making finn hook up with rose instead of poe are things that rian can be blamed for and etc, but still. the last jedi is not a movie i like or dislike. im forgiving for how the movie had to follow up on the bad things tfa did and actually didnt in some places which is neat, but theyre still bad and i have no obilgation to love it and some people felt like the subversions were anti-climatic.",1608780058
75,DreamWorks,Maybe The Last Jedi,1608778943
76,DreamWorks,"im curious whats a movie that you can't agree on any critisisms. for me, it's hunchback. there are only a few critisisms i agree with like the gargoyles being annoying, but a handful are ones that i dont share with others. at least i know that hunchback doesnt have the seperation cliche or wrong representation of history or a killing protagonist or wish plotholes (not critisisms of just shrek, which some aren't anyway). and it doesnt rub it in my face that it's subverting either, like shrek or frozen.",1608778355
77,DreamWorks,I can love my mom even though she isn't perfect,1608772329
78,DreamWorks,"parody is a grey area sometimes, but katzenburg definitely made the parody with bitterness in mind.",1608765658
79,DreamWorks,im just saying how you can enjoy one when its problems are pointed out,1608765606
80,DreamWorks,Maybe but I think their movies are trash now,1608691657
81,DreamWorks,DreamWorks barely has any memorable villains. It's kind of a useless debate.,1608688698
82,DreamWorks,"Atrocious? Dude, we just got The Croods 2 which was a one GOOD ASS movie, I don't think they've downgraded in quality at all. I think you have a case of nostalgia my friend.",1608688622
83,DreamWorks,Facts only. Btw I have a croods subreddit r/the_croods if you're interested üòÑüòÑ,1608688443
84,DreamWorks,"Unlikely. HTTYD was their critical and financial darling, there's no way they are going to pass up on making an adaptation from the same author.",1608616811
85,DreamWorks,"I just watched Frozen 2 for the first time last night. It sucked.  I thought the first one was overrated but quite good (Tangled was much better), the second one was just a mess.",1608587822
86,DreamWorks,"It wouldn't be ""bouncing relationships"", Eep could be with Guy and Dawn at the same time. It's called a poly relationship, which doesn't get much representation in films, and I think it would have opened a lot of eyes. If DreamWorks didnt want us shipping Eep and Dawn, they shouldn't have included the ""girlfriend"" line. It's queerbaiting at that point and that's why I think they were cowardly. If your gonna hint at their relationship like that just to make them solely bffs that's kinda messed up. But that's just my opinion....",1608518741
87,DreamWorks,"I don‚Äôt think dream works is cowardly. They shouldn‚Äôt be supporting families breaking apart by other people coming in. Plus the bettermen are very pushy and dreamworks shouldn‚Äôt teach kids to follow pushy parents in unhealthy situations. Plus we also shouldn‚Äôt see people bouncing relationships or not wanting to commit in the future. That‚Äôs why we have such big divorce rates. We should be encouraging happy healthy relationships. To add to, just because the girls are close doesn‚Äôt mean their more than friends. That‚Äôs how best friends all.",1608518518
88,DreamWorks,They certainly should there's so much potential,1608475521
89,DreamWorks,"Just watched the movie in theatre today, it was quite entertaining.",1608380696
90,DreamWorks,[deleted],1608354699
91,DreamWorks,I hope  so tooo,1608326624
92,DreamWorks,Well they are not gay guy and eep fix things but eep and dawn do have good vibe i hope if there is ever a new part they will get a shot together. Im not gay myself but i think they fit much better together,1608326601
93,DreamWorks,I really hoppee soo dint think so tho im watching it now,1608323661
94,DreamWorks,True,1608294422

96,DreamWorks,shit list,1608284018
97,DreamWorks,It's not really a crime to like both?,1608283684
98,DreamWorks,"I think it‚Äôs the people who have owned this company have a lot of the blame. I think them targeting kids with movies such as trolls, boss baby, and home are what drag this company down. I think DreamWorks would‚Äôve have been able to have an identity had it stuck to the formula that had kickstarted them into success, Shrek is a great example of this. Had they stuck to making movies a bit more mature than Pixar, but also entertaining towards kids DreamWorks could have possibly outshined Pixar. But corporate meddling is usually why a company is the way it is, Pixar‚Äôs situation isn‚Äôt really great right now. Currently A sequel to UP is underworks and a origin story to Buzz Lightyear will be released next year. I don‚Äôt see any hope for DreamWorks if they don‚Äôt utilize what made them successful in the first place, I‚Äôd blame corporate meddling and movies like trolls and home for the reason why DreamWorks typically nowadays underperforms against Pixar and Disney. It‚Äôs sad to see that for awhile, DreamWorks would outperform both studios, but corporate meddling",1608280502
99,DreamWorks,"Dreamworks peaked during the Paramount era, when movies like Kung Fu Panda, HTTYD, Megamind, ROTG, Madagascar, etc. came out. But their best era IMO is when they made 2D animated movies.",1608274142

7,DreamWorks,"this guy fucking gets it. there is a difference between playful mockery, such as parodies, and outright criticism.",1608249776

31,DreamWorks,"But frozen and ralphs sequels were still mediocre at best. It's weird bc disney has the most resources and budgets to make long lasting franchises but they dont put effort into their sequels. They create the most generic continuations while DreamWorks spends time thinking of a way to re-invent/re-ignite interest in the characters and a REASON for a sequel, even for movies where there was no obvious continuation. They are so good at crafting new original stories where most studios take the generic cashgrab route. Not that dreamworks doesnt make those films sometimes, but overall they usually make their sequels worthy titles.",1607729202

3.- Kung fu panda.                    
4.- Madagascar.",1606016797
51,DreamWorks,i completely forgot that lol,1605967466
52,DreamWorks,"i think rumpel ahould be higher than farquaad, the difference between him and farquaad is that he won, he enslaved entire ogre race and wanted to kill shrek, he killed a witch with cold blood and told her plan after her death, he ruled entire far far away and made sure nobody will go for fiona (farquaad had no magic mirror and prince charming probably knew she isn't royal anymore since her parents didn't exist after the contract they signed with rumpel) and was serious threat to the people he was giving deals for, since as in post, the contracts only benefited him",1605963945
53,DreamWorks,Thank you!,1605918001
54,DreamWorks,"Ah, I see.

But still, DreamWorks was willing to spend more than $100 million on **How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World** and **Trolls World Tour**, and it looks like $120 million is basically the budget range for DreamWorks Animation going forward:

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/dreamworks-animation-turns-25-a-fairy-tale-like-youve-never-seen-1245920

Why did they decide to spend so little on **The Croods: A New Age** by comparison?",1605898134
55,DreamWorks,The characters in the first film looked a lot dirtier than they do in the sequel.,1605897840
56,DreamWorks,"Smaller budget doesn't exactly surprise me, but $65 million? I feel like that's something else entirely.

Also, when you say ""they've been cleaned up in the sequel"", what do you mean by this?",1605897588
57,DreamWorks,"In my opinion, A New Age actually doesn't look as good as the first film in terms of visuals, so it probably did have a smaller budget. The first Croods had a budget even larger than both How to Train Your Dragon sequels, which is why the Croods look like they've been cleaned up in the sequel.",1605872175

72,DreamWorks,"The movie grossed $603 million worldwide, which made it at the time the 44th highest-grossing movie in the world (it would've been the 43rd if Star Wars 1 (1977) had never been re-released) and the 9th highest-grossing animated movie in the world (behind Shrek 2, Finding Nemo, Shrek 3, The Lion King, Ice Age 2, Kung Fu Panda 1, The Incredibles 1 and Ratatouille).

39,DreamWorks,Omg Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è,1601107041
40,DreamWorks,i mean the show's ending heavily implied a second movie,1601090581
41,DreamWorks,"Walk Of Life - Dire Straits I'm fairly certain
Don't know which movie though",1601067882
42,DreamWorks,Pretty sure that‚Äôs from an antidepressant ad or something,1601066967

44,DreamWorks,I love this!!! It's so cute!,1600851219
45,DreamWorks,"Yeah I think a rewatch for Wallace and Gromit maybe but I wouldn‚Äôt put them higher than a B myself.

How to train your dragon should be S their, not only is it the best work from dreamworks it competes with Disney, Sony and other animation studios as one of the greatest animated trilogies. Rivalling the likes of toy story even. It‚Äôs animation is beyond incredible, especially it‚Äôs story telling through no dialogue.

Rise of guardians for me was funny, Jack Frost is someone I relate to a lot as the core message of his character is finding the person that you are at your centre. Not only that I liked the twist on our favourites such as Russian Santa or Australian bunny, who I thought was comedic gold. On top of that pitch black is one of if not the best villain created by dreamworks. I know it has its problems and isn‚Äôt perfect by any means but I think it deserves B tier at least, I would place it at S tier but hey it‚Äôs subjective so who knows lol",1600848821
46,DreamWorks,It‚Äôs going to be a playable remake of all three movies,1600839880
47,DreamWorks,"What do you mean? httyd is already high. Rise of the guardians is overrated imo, people like it because Jack Frost is hot. In my opinion Jack Frost is like Olaf lol. 

I watched Wallace and Gromit movies and God their plots was so dark. Maybe if I were to rate again it would be a B-",1600838955
48,DreamWorks,"Actually I think I watch over the hedge before. If I'm not wrong it us about this raccoon thrashing the suburban with his friends and stealing stuffs. Maybe it is not too bad, but it is a meh for me and I wouldn't rewatch. I really like the Croods because the plot is quite touching and it involves with real family problems and hardships like jealousy between father and boyfriend. The setting is also fresh. I think I have watched the film for more than 3 times lmao.",1600838476
49,DreamWorks,apart from over the hedge and croods i agree with this,1600827584
50,DreamWorks,"Top 10:
10-The Cat in the Hat
9-Kung Fu Panda
8-Flushed Away
7-Chicken Run
6-Shrek
5-Shrek 2
4-American Beauty 
3-Norbit
2-Gladiator
1-Catch me if you can",1600669676
51,DreamWorks,Lol.,1600654330
52,DreamWorks,"With Escape 2 Africa, I didn‚Äôt like it as much for two reasons. First, they tried to stuff way too many plot lines into a 80 minute movie. Second, I kinda missed the group dynamic from the first one. 

In the first movie, the zoo family went through everything together, while in the second one, they spent most of the runtime separated except for the very beginning and very end.",1600631105
53,DreamWorks,"The whole joy of the first film was them trying to get home to Madagascar. Escape to Africa wasn‚Äôt as good because they moved away from that concept of home to family, which is far more cliche. What made it worse is that it took away from Alex‚Äôs zoo family and made it seem like he had a new one. So I‚Äôm not surprised they wrote them out tbh",1600630698
54,DreamWorks,"After watching the second one, I was expecting Alex‚Äôs parents to continue on to the third film. I was surprised that they were quietly written out",1600630334
55,DreamWorks,"Didn‚Äôt Madagascar 3 kind of wrap things up?

They had the gang briefly return to the zoo. The animals realized that going back wasn‚Äôt what they expected and that they were much happier traveling. Alex gave up his dream of returning to the zoo on his own terms, and they decided to join the circus permanently.",1600616208
56,DreamWorks,The latest religion animated film that I know of was Joshua and the Promised land. It may just be the worst movie ever.,1600601331
57,DreamWorks,"Maybe king Julians parents didn‚Äôt want to be king/queen, and Julian was next in line after them.",1600601151
58,DreamWorks,"If they make a movie about going to the loo, they will end up in the loo. It is average for me",1600599747
59,DreamWorks,Over the hedge isn't so bad,1600593094
60,DreamWorks,flushed away deserves better than this,1600591511
61,DreamWorks,"Trolls world tour is a C, criticism is allowed",1600590207
62,DreamWorks,"Shrek the musical on its own is actually very good. the humor, the stages and set pieces, the music and the actors. If you get a chance to watch clips of the broadway musical, with Sutton Foster, it‚Äôs worth watching!",1600581505
63,DreamWorks,Shrek the halls needs to be higher,1600564239
64,DreamWorks,Not really. And most of the Wallace and Gromit memes are taken from A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers.,1600561733
65,DreamWorks,"Does nobody think Shrek Forever After is one of the best Shreks or is it just me? I have a hard time between 1, 2 and Forever is my favourite. Completely different story in 4 but man it hits pretty hard at times",1600549408
66,DreamWorks,is there Spirit memes?,1600538850
67,DreamWorks,the what?,1600538685
68,DreamWorks,Okay but shrek the musical is freaking amazing! I don't know how these charts work.,1600537317
69,DreamWorks,That's how I feel Everytime I go into work,1600420653
70,DreamWorks,Damn it hit me in the feels,1600418964
71,DreamWorks,It‚Äôs perfect,1600418927
72,DreamWorks,"I like Captain underpants, but it doesn‚Äôt get much notice cause it‚Äôs a pretty big standard movie. The animation is kinda cool I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1600418816
73,DreamWorks,This should be a new meme,1600377205
74,DreamWorks,"So apparently, the title for DreamWorks Animation's upcoming SPIRIT RIDING FREE film adaptation (opening May 14, 2021) will be SPIRIT UNTAMED, and they've got a logo to boot

6,DreamWorks,"It won an Oscar, made $100m+ in America, got great reviews, and people still remember it fondly. Underrated, this is not.",1599330869
7,DreamWorks,Easily HTTYD or KFP. I think HTTYD is more consistant across the 3 films as a whole but both are good options,1599327859
8,DreamWorks,2 and 3 are great but 1 is award-winning for a reason. My top 3 are 1. Test drive (film 1) 2. Forbidden friendship (film 1) and then 3. Stoicks ship (film 2),1599327808

21,DreamWorks,Love it üòÇüòÇ,1598945909
22,DreamWorks,"From what I can think of there is 5?? Out of the 36 films Dreamworks have made, also dragons by definition are supernatural, made up. So if your gunna count Kai a talking ox, and Rumplestiltskin who lives in a world of dragons and ogres and magic, then you could at least count the red death from the first how to train your dragon film right? So that‚Äôd make it 6.

Altogether tho I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs a lack of super natural villains in DreamWorks. Almost every villain of a dreamworks films suits their role perfectly. For example, could you imagine flushed away with a supernatural villain? Over the hedge? Chicken run? All these films plus more don‚Äôt need a supernatural villain as they are routed in telling an important human moral message. Dreamworks likes to do that through animals it seems rather than the supernatural which I don‚Äôt mind at all.",1598945842
23,DreamWorks,That's not a knife.,1598913438
24,DreamWorks,That's honestly all I could think of though.,1598890603
25,DreamWorks,Smek is not supernatural. Every power he possesses comes naturally. Same with Ms. Grunion. Pitch black and Hal count though.,1598888425
26,DreamWorks,"Pitch Black (Rise of the Guardians 2012)  
Hal Stuart (Megamind 2010)  
I'm pretty sure Home (2016)  and Mr. Peabody and Sherman probably can fall into the ""supernatural"" category as well. But, you are correct, that's all I can think of.",1598887454

34,DreamWorks,Crave has it if you have the Movies + HBO subscription,1598311785
35,DreamWorks,It‚Äôs on a website called myflixer,1598302057
36,DreamWorks,It is on Hulu.,1598292092
37,DreamWorks,Itunes or amazon?  Kind of cheap to buy it now at walmart. Good luck,1598290574
38,DreamWorks,buy the DVD from places such as charity shops or ebay (or similar sites),1598289244
39,DreamWorks,"I think that Megamind is no longer an underrated movie, now many people know its true value",1598288464
40,DreamWorks,sadly there is no Boss Wolf bio and yes Shen is more likeable and silghtly more interesting with the backstory,1598177652
41,DreamWorks,"Can verify. Totally my boyfriend/his other partner on the boys side (sometimes they decide a spider in their house is ""safe"" and will feed it. And they never, ever kill them) and me on the girls' side (they come in MY house and their lives are forfeit).",1598161154
42,DreamWorks,"Is there a Wolf Boss bio? I always hear the ""Shen was kind of the wolves"" thing passed around but have never seen it actually mentioned by an official source. I always figured the old bios that still mentioned the cut backstories would've been where it came from, if it actually did come from Dreamworks (I've heard of old bios but never found screenshots before).

I always feel like removing this stuff was a mistake. Aside from how a lot of people seem to like Shen better with the backstory, it would've contributed nicely to the adoption themes (I've never seen an official source flat out use the term for those two before). It even had a setup unique for the franchise that never ended up popping up anywhere; a scenario where being adopted was 100%, definitely the better option because the biological parents are awful (everyone else that's adopted either doesn't know their bio parents or they turn out to be loving). 

Also I guess at one point it was twenty years ago. Wonder what changed that.",1598149954
43,DreamWorks,What if Madagascar 4 will be an origin story?,1598097516
44,DreamWorks,Hopefully,1598040608
45,DreamWorks,"Np glad I could clear it up lol, but yeah, as much as I want to see Mr P and S sequel, it was likely only a small movie to turn a quick profit. We may get one in the future when dreamworks has grown financially but not anytime soon",1598040570
46,DreamWorks,"Oh, I understand now, thanks for the reply!",1598040501
47,DreamWorks,"Yeah I know and that‚Äôs what I mean by quick profit movies, smaller movies that earn enough to keep the company a float while it works on its bigger movies, like the HTTYD or KFP. 
Small pay days to keep them going until a big pay day. They do this with their tv series as well.
Disney dont haft to do this because they‚Äôre so large now, owning marvel, 20th century fox, multiple theme parks etc etc lol. Which is why their movies always do incredible at the box office, because they‚Äôre more refined and better advertised.
Dreamworks dosent have that luxury yet",1598040438
48,DreamWorks,"HTTYD 3 is a sequel, World tour is a sequel, KFP 3 is a sequel, and boss baby was a weird case, and I also said original movies, meaning movies that aren't sequels, I mean abominable only got 189 million, and Captain Underpants also underperformed with 126 Million.",1598040255
49,DreamWorks,"You say that but they kinda do, trolls world tour flopped cause of corona so big rip but other movies have done well

HTTYD hidden world made 519 million USD, boss baby made 528 million, KFP 521 million. These are all good profits from movies released in the last 4 years (since 2016).

They aren‚Äôt as big as Disney but that‚Äôs because they haven‚Äôt been around long enough, resulting in short quick cheap movies that turn a good profit even without a good box office release, movies such as abominable or Captain underpants",1598040037
50,DreamWorks,It's actually sad that the newer original dreamworks movies don't do well at the box office,1598039786
51,DreamWorks,"That‚Äôs got very little to do with it, the reason shrek 2 was so successful was because shrek 1 also made 500 million USD so was also a huge success. 

Also you say Shrek 2 only had the incredibkes to compete with.... when the incredibkes made 633 million USD that year dominating the box office really.

Furthermore, many of the films released with mr Peabody and Sherman were sequels as you clearly state, which means they had tremendous hype going into them so they made more money. Mr P and S do not have that same hype and so will likely make no where near enough money to be worth making it.

I wish we could see it but it‚Äôs unlikely for some time if ever",1598039707
52,DreamWorks,[deleted],1598039677
53,DreamWorks,"I mean, that's because shrek 2 had little to no competition, the only real competition was The incredibles, meanwhile Mr. Peabody and Sherman had HTTYD 2, Big Hero 6, Lego Movie, Penguins of Madagascar, Rio 2, etc.",1598039284
54,DreamWorks,"Considering shrek 2 made almost 900 million, it‚Äôs not great either",1598038994
55,DreamWorks,"It got 275 Million, which is not that bad for dreamworks",1598038849
56,DreamWorks,Most likely won't happen because of how it underperformed at the box office.,1598017240
57,DreamWorks,I think it should be just Madagascar 2.,1597868221
58,DreamWorks,"I'm almost certain the above images are from dreamworks themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty sure this was the idea Dreamworks settled on however you are 100% correct with the 2 different ideas on Shen.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally prefer his parents not looking after him and the soothsayer instead being Shens parental figure which you can see in the movie.",1597859802
59,DreamWorks,"The information on Lord Shen is what they were planning to do with Shen at first - make him ill so that his parents would leave him. But they changed their mind and made Shen the psychotic one since his childhood and his parents the good-hearted ones.
Still don't know which story is better..",1597856035
60,DreamWorks,"Seems a bit more targeted to younger kids than as an all ages show compared to All Hail King Julien And The Penguins Of Madagascar but you can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover, I hope it has the penguins and King julien characters in it though.",1597803928

66,DreamWorks,"!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!

I think the way the creators ended the series is great. In my own imagination, both parties will travel to visit each other as often as possible. Kids of both parties will grow up basicly as bff's and have adventures of their own.

You can see all of them being happy at the end.",1597626192
67,DreamWorks,Its part of his instincts to want to create off spring,1597621183

71,DreamWorks,"Toothless has not moved on from Hiccup at all, these options are very limited. Toothless was just forced to the hidden world, he didn‚Äôt get the option to stay with hiccup.",1597601920
72,DreamWorks,I know your a big fan of How to train your dragon and the relationship between Toothless and hiccup but this is like the 8th post or something that I‚Äôve seen from you about the same topic. It‚Äôs starting to get spammy now so can you please tone it down a bit?,1597601675

75,DreamWorks,What was the point of the forbidden friendship scene and their adorable cute bonding if he has moved on and doesn‚Äôt think he belongs with him anymore?,1597590296
76,DreamWorks,Interesting as every single poll i have conducted on this before has had the outcome that he belongs with hiccup. Well... maybe hicctooth fans (of which there are more) haven‚Äôt seen this yet,1597588990
77,DreamWorks,I would actually prefer giving a bath to Astrid,1597587084
78,DreamWorks,"One of my favorites from last year, loved it!",1597528422
79,DreamWorks,"I think it is an amazing movie and had the same level of potential as How to train your dragon. However a few characters and scenes felt unnecessary or too cliche often not having a unique trait or reminding feature about them. 
Pair thr with poor advertisement and unfortunately it just isn‚Äôt as good as films like httyd

But the visuals are stunning and soundtrack is üëåüèªüëåüèª",1597514733
80,DreamWorks,I think it was nice movie,1597513628
81,DreamWorks,"I don't know, I just listen to it on Spotify",1597513056
82,DreamWorks,Do that have that in Cd format I want to buy it. I love it as well. Thank  you for the reply,1597512653
83,DreamWorks,"I could fall asleep to the soundtrack, it's so relaxing",1597512466
84,DreamWorks,"No toothless dosent have a choice that‚Äôs the whole point of the 3rd film. They are forced into exile by people not willing to except that they can be peaceful creatures.

So he cannot reunite with hiccup permanently or else he would. And that dosent happen. And I don‚Äôt know what you mean it‚Äôs a fact, we saw in the Christmas special and at the end of 3 that they reunited one last time and that was it, he never permanently went back to him even with that opportunity",1597496943
85,DreamWorks,"No, when he reunited with Hiccup again he would wear the saddle/red tail fin when flying with him again. Besides TOOTHLESS has a choice

\- does he stay in the hidden world 

\-or reunite permanently with Hiccup

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is fact from what we have seen already he would choose the latter",1597496725
86,DreamWorks,"Yeah but Toothless is living in the hidden world, and knows that he likely won‚Äôt see hiccup for decades, he would still keep the saddle but in order for the other dragons to respect him he would probably take it off",1597496252
87,DreamWorks,I think toothless values Hiccup more than what other dragons want,1597496134
88,DreamWorks,"Mega mind and flushed away are both level for me, personally I choose flushed away because to me it‚Äôs slightly funnier but both are A*. Also Abominable is a good film too but it left a lot of fans disappointed, I was expecting a new trilogy like HTTYD or something but it ended up being a one off film for kids, still got some incredible scenes tho",1597486565
89,DreamWorks,Thank youuuuu I‚Äôm thinking of writing a post about how good it is,1597486509
90,DreamWorks,"Agreed, also think that maybe some dragons may not like toothless wearing it cause of poor experiences with humans so he may take it off for their sake, we really can‚Äôt say for sure",1597486453
91,DreamWorks,"Yes exactly, because Madagascar is a silly film that‚Äôs more about making kids laugh then have a compelling story. It does have a compelling story even with one wrong word in the title.

Their main market for the films was kids, so making it sound cool and look good for kids is essential. Which the title Escape 2 Africa does.

So altogether I think yeah your right story wise it dosent make sense but it isn‚Äôt that big a deal and it makes perfect sense business wise",1597486128
92,DreamWorks,Yeah but can you really excuse the blatant plot contradiction in the title with 'oh but look funny pun haha it's a sequel'?,1597485385
93,DreamWorks,"It‚Äôs the second film, so escape 2 Africa is better for advertising",1597483718
94,DreamWorks,Kung fu panda as a whole is better then zootopia but kp3 is prob only on par with zootopia. Its such a huge film compared to kung fu panda,1597350068
95,DreamWorks,That sounds interesting! Animal rights has been one of the themes in the films so I could see something like that happening. Thanks for sharing.,1597343008
96,DreamWorks,"I personally think it might take place around the same time of the penguins of Madagascar film took place. In the Penguins' film they're on their own adventure who's to say the Madagascar gang wasn't doing something like that too? Maybe something goes wrong in the circus and the gang has to deal with permits or something and the villain is someone who has suspicions about the circus and if there are humans running it or something. And since the penguins generally handle this type of thing the gang would leave it up to them, but they're not so they're on their own this time. whatever happens in the film the gang will still be in the circus or something like that and we get to see the animals talking about animal rights along the way. That's just my thought, but you can disagree.",1597342377
97,DreamWorks,Both of them had sub par humor. Kfp1 is still among the best animated movies of all time. 3 had a better special effects than zootopia for sure. But when it comes to everything kung fu panda 1 itself was better.,1597342265
98,DreamWorks,"Over the hedge should be at least in the a area it is too good and too funny, and I think it really should've gotten a sequel at least. The Madagascar franchise as a whole should be in the b to a area, it is terribly underrated. I think Boss Baby should be a bit higher on the list, I personally liked it it was funny and a good story (feel free to disagree with me it's just my opinion). As for the films in the haven't watched yet category, the penguins of Madagascar should be in the b area Abominable should be in the d area while the rest I cannot weigh in upon as I have not watched them.",1597341536
99,DreamWorks,"That's quite unpopular - Zootopia was a lot better than what people let on and KFP 3 was a good film, not excellent.",1597311045
0,DreamWorks,"I disagree, the world building in zootopia is as good as any other animated movie. On top of that it does do well it challenging diversity as well as keeping it light hearted and fun imo. Great way to teach kids about racism and diversity",1597310541
1,DreamWorks,I dont think,1597309915
2,DreamWorks,I would say Hiccup would rise at Toothless‚Äô mercy. Giving Toothless full control but trusting Toothless to work as one unit. So neither answer on here but a mix,1597284627
3,DreamWorks,What do you think? Post in comment s,1597257973
4,DreamWorks,This is very thought out,1597252461
5,DreamWorks,That creepy horror has a trouble! ;D,1597211171
6,DreamWorks,"It's good but they were all good, so I ranked them by how much they impacted me",1597190656
7,DreamWorks,"For me, 2nd is more relatable probably due to hiccup being older so I agree. But both 1 and 2 are sublime, wouldn‚Äôt change much about either of them. 3 is a little weaker but still strong",1597187832
8,DreamWorks,Thanks for the list!,1597187818
9,DreamWorks,Oh yeah. Personally I like the 2nd one over the first one,1597187742
10,DreamWorks,"It‚Äôs Trollhunters then 3 Below and last is Wizards. I didn‚Äôt like Wizards as much though. It‚Äôs worth it if you want the full overarching story but it is the weakest of the 3. 

Also they‚Äôre made by Guillermo Del Torro",1597187690
11,DreamWorks,"The way they reconnected in the film was Golden, perfectly done",1597187597
12,DreamWorks,I might check them out!,1597187492
13,DreamWorks,Oh yeah. It always hurts to lose someone. And anger is a valid reaction. I‚Äôd be mad too. I am glad it worked out though.,1597187415
14,DreamWorks,They‚Äôre on a Netflix series from Dreamworks called 3 Below: Tales of Arcadia. The Tales of Arcadia stories are really good. I would recommend it. But look up which order to watch it in. It does matter since the stories collide at points.,1597187339
15,DreamWorks,Who are Stuart and Gwen?,1597184182
16,DreamWorks,"I completely agree, I even think that Hiccups shout and anger at toothless is justified, I would be the same if someone I loved killed my father. Regardless of whether or not it was their fault",1597173835
17,DreamWorks,"Toothless was under the Alphas control. He had no choice in the matter. It was really obvious that Toothless was powerless to stop his actions at that time. It was only after that Toothless was able to regain control and show dominance over the alpha and in that regard, Drago. It was not his fault. It was just the nature of how dragons work in that world. And Hiccup eventually figured it out and forgave Toothless.",1597168060
18,DreamWorks,"Bad thing, right",1597147907
19,DreamWorks,He has done it tho :/,1597146229
20,DreamWorks,He wasn‚Äôt in his senses,1597139608
21,DreamWorks,"Same , KFP is great",1597138385
22,DreamWorks,"Kung Fu Panda without a doubt..
Btw where is Shrek?",1597138336
23,DreamWorks,"I agree, we don‚Äôt want them pushed aside like the Madagascar 2 characters were",1597131097
24,DreamWorks,He did when Toothless killed his dad.,1597114531
25,DreamWorks,"It's between Madagascar and Megamind for me. I think Madagascar edges it, but only just.",1597107853
26,DreamWorks,"I think that having the train burn would be an interesting plot device, especially as a way to go deeper into how fire affects Vitaly after what happened to him.

Mostly, I would want wto see more development in Gia, Vitaly, and Stefano.",1597107258
27,DreamWorks,Your last spot is my first!,1597090914
28,DreamWorks,"Yeah, I agree! I love that it ended with Hiccup and Astrid all grown up and with their kids. In ended in a sweet, mature, (maybe bittersweet) note and I think the story concluded strongly. I was actually crying in the theater, I wasn't expecting it.",1597087659
29,DreamWorks,"The third film was amazing however a bit of a let down because there was so many delays in I release that by the tome it was released the story had been predicted. Also there were problems with the story, felt a bit forced.

But still an amazing movie",1597086267
30,DreamWorks,"Yeah I agree. I heard a little hate for the third movie but honestly, I thought all the HTTYD films were great. That's why I love DreamWorks more than Disney, the sequels are actually worth watching.",1597086073
31,DreamWorks,"And your opinion is totally valid, The croods is an amazing movie and I can see why it appeals to people I really do.

But I‚Äôm terms of an overall product and quality of execution. Basically the technical side of things, HTTYD is easily superior to other dreamworks movies, not even Shrek or KFP can come close to the quality of those films (on a theatrical stand point).",1597085957
32,DreamWorks,I respect your opinion. I think I slightly prefer The Croods just because I was drawn to the Guy and Eep more than Hiccup and Astrid. Httyd is an impressive trilogy. We'll have to see what The Croods 2 will bring to the table.,1597085806
33,DreamWorks,"I haft to strongly disagree with you. (Altough ynderstand why you think that)

First of all in terms of world building, cross is an age before time following one family, it‚Äôs not hard to build a world like that at all. I agree that the cinematography is great however the characters aren‚Äôt as relatable to the overall audience and instead is specific to one or two types of problems.

How to train your dragon does have the superior world building as it‚Äôs got complex history, leaves us with questions such as who is Hiccups mother and in the sequels develops on those as well as building new characters. It also has superior Cinematography for one simple reason, silent acting, aka scenes that develop characters (specifically toothless and hiccup) without any dialogue at all. The croods has nothing like this or at least no where near on the same scale.

And this isn‚Äôt even mentioning the sound track",1597085597
34,DreamWorks,"I think The Croods was just as great, if not better than the HTTYD series. Has the same excellent world building, creativity, characters, themes and emotional moments. The cinematography was stunning in that film. Imo it's at least tied",1597085315
35,DreamWorks,"HTTYD knocks it out of the park easily, the other films are all great too but HTTYD is another level, up there with films like Spiderman into the Spider-Verse as the best animations of all time",1597085207
36,DreamWorks,I love httyd and madagaskar,1597077521
37,DreamWorks,"That is really hard I love them all. I also love Abominable,  that was not listed.",1597074015
38,DreamWorks,Also Flushed Away is an underrated gem and that's that,1597073114
39,DreamWorks,"My list:
1. The Croods
2. HTTYD
3. Megamind
4. Madagascar
5. Rise of the Guardians
6. Kung Fu Panda

They're all good films but this is my personal ranking",1597073047
40,DreamWorks,Spirit is worth watching and HTTYD and Kung Fu Panda is worth watching again :D,1597072538
41,DreamWorks,"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, in my opinion. I might be a little biased since it is my favorite movie of all time, but it's an underrated gem that deserves a lot more attention than it does. All of these other movies are wonderful too though.",1597070228
42,DreamWorks,"The official explanation was that button is supposed to be triggered when they sit down.  Cuz you know, that's when people make ""funny sounds""... when they sit on a chair.  @_@",1597059891
43,DreamWorks,"I'm with ya bud. You're not alone. In fact, I just had the pleasure of watching it in theaters for my grad party.",1597033122
44,DreamWorks,Yeah it would just be weird if she was not in it.,1597002820
45,DreamWorks,What was on there it‚Äôs been removed?,1596998676
46,DreamWorks,"If they make Sheek 5 without Fiona then it will not be good, further proof they are milking the franchise dry of money",1596998578
47,DreamWorks,I loved the scene when Don Lino exploded Bernie's head for trying to climb the whale-wash.,1596909791
48,DreamWorks,i would personally say after 2:35,1596845209
49,DreamWorks,[deleted],1596845158
50,DreamWorks,I would really miss her too.,1596836355
51,DreamWorks,*Noooooooooo*,1596824066
52,DreamWorks,They are a good trio but I just think it would feel weird to have a Shrek movie without Fiona.,1596822666
53,DreamWorks,"I could be ready for that. I want an only Shrek, Donkey and Puss version again. Love that trio!",1596820927
54,DreamWorks,Agreed. Since 1:10 started the best parts,1596754618
55,DreamWorks,i agree 100%,1596726137
56,DreamWorks,[deleted],1596726126
57,DreamWorks,"yikes! Not only did someone design this, several people must have approved it, tested it and decided this was fine lol. What were they thinking?",1596720890
58,DreamWorks,I don't think the ending is upsetting. Toothless needed to be with his own kind and so had to leave Hiccup. Even though their friendship might have seemed special and as if they were the best of friends and would be best friends forever etc. it was ultimately the right decision for toothless to leave Hiccup and I don't think they should see each other again. I think Toothless belongs with his own kind and will easily find new and better friends among them,1596633204
59,DreamWorks,"don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

Its as clear as day Toothless prefers the female. Not my fault some fans are unable to accept it.",1596632231
60,DreamWorks,on what evidence?,1596632134
61,DreamWorks,Most people disagree with you sorry:(,1596631832
62,DreamWorks,He is more happy with the light fury. If he liked hiccup more he would of stayed with hiccup forever,1596630144
63,DreamWorks,"Sorry? He is happy with Hiccup, more so than with the light fury",1596628614
64,DreamWorks,i having a feeling someone doesn't like the fact that toothless got a happy ending,1596628181
65,DreamWorks,"This sounds exactly like what the place was like several months ago. I don't know why you seem surprised. 

I presume the thing is one of those ongoing jokes that loses all luster after ten seconds for all but like three people, who just keep going with it.",1596598603
66,DreamWorks,"Last one on the first row, first one on the second row and fourth one on the first row are my favorites",1596597150
67,DreamWorks,KFP for me,1596596325
68,DreamWorks,KFP by far,1596596117
69,DreamWorks,I haven't seen it yet so I don't know ü§∑.,1596481777
70,DreamWorks,I agree completely with this so I didn‚Äôt vote lol,1596476942
71,DreamWorks,I agree with this but I also think it shows that the world can‚Äôt always change when you want it to,1596476912
72,DreamWorks,I wanted to see more of Snotlaut and Eret :(,1596471727
73,DreamWorks,"Yea, it was a pretty disappointing ending that went against the entire point of the franchise for no reason. The whole point was to show that dragons and humans are indeed capable of living and working with each other, but then the third movie arbitrarily goes against that just to be different.",1596470373
74,DreamWorks,"Well the most upsetting thing was that we didn't get to see a lot of the side characters, it was just Hiccup, Toothless, Lightfury, and Astrid basically the whole movie, but then again, that's basically every HTTYD movie sadly.

77,DreamWorks,"Nothing.  
Movie is (pardon my French) FRIKIN LIT!",1596453173
78,DreamWorks,"The third film fundamentally betrays what the first two are thematically about. It‚Äôs an aprupt about-turn that replaces the original optimistic/idealistic heart of the first two with defeatism.
You almost have to wonder if something bad happed to Dean IRL that changed his outlook on life. It‚Äôs utterly bizzare.
Hiccup‚Äôs entire character development is flushed down the toilet. Everything he fought for in 2, his quest for an identity distinct from his mother and father, a better world - forgotten about. 
Not to mention the film‚Äôs story is bland and boring, with a villain somehow even less compelling and one-dimensional than Drago and a plot so basic and uninteresting it could have been written for the TV show. 
More like ‚ÄúHow to give up and leave your Dragon‚Äù",1596430823

83,DreamWorks,The third film split apart our two best buddies hiccup and toothless because it promotes the stupid message that a best friend is inferior to a marital partner.. and that too a TOXIC one who wanted toothless to herself. Dean even said that the aim of 3 is to lure toothless away from hiccup and i can assure you most people do not like or agree with that,1596370043

8,DreamWorks,"The light Fury, he has an extremely strong bond with hiccup of course but it almost dosent matter.

For most animals (including humans) life is about leaving it for the next generation. Hiccup had Astrid and toothless had no body so the light fury was essential not only to toothless personally but to the survival of the night fury‚Äôs",1596186418

10,DreamWorks,"Good job taking things out of context, buddy. The Shenists as depicted here are exaggerated and demonized. The actual group is nothing like how Jammy describes it here (Ask the members!) and is actually quite a welcoming, calm and peaceful group.  


"" The higher ranking members also have there votes in the democratic area worth 5 and 20 votes""

It's actually five and then fifteen. Also, you forget about the mutiny vote system, where if a 95% majority is reached the leader can't overrule it. Also, leaders can be impeached.",1596112861
11,DreamWorks,"i can say myself, from a non-bias point of view that the shenists are not Nazis, Extremists nor horrible to anyone. The Shensists welcome any and all new members regardless of their backgrounds. The democratic system is just a extra and has little to no impact on the community and its purpose. Shenists purpose is to unite all the shen fans into one fair and equal group, here you portrayed it as a Nazi regime of shen which is entirely false. Jammy not only you are respected inside the shenists but a valued member and making up 3 paragraphs of nothing but hate towards the group is a bit of a dick move.",1596109889

I personally thought tai lung was cooler ü§£ü§£",1596091170
15,DreamWorks,"Haha Shen is great lol, he is like a mad man, hell bent on being the most powerful. The reason I prefer tai lung is because he couldn‚Äôt care leas about ruling China, he just wants strength and revenge on Oogway and Sheifu, plus I loved his dialogue and the voice acting was perfect",1596063476
16,DreamWorks,"Yea thats not a bad idea. Also i'm gonna have to ban you for not saying Shen is the best.

&amp;#x200B;

joking ;)",1596063377
17,DreamWorks,"Hmmm I just really really like tai lung lol, he is the best kfp villain in my opinion, it would be cool to send him back as an advisor maybe for Po if not another villain, I think he and tigress could have a great rivalry and have contrasting opinions as to how to help Po defeat Kai",1596057501
18,DreamWorks,I dislike the idea of Tai ever returning as a villain as i like to believe he learnt his lesson in the spirit realm by meeting up with oogway or something,1596049430

KFP is both more emotional and entertaining",1595884600
24,DreamWorks,"I agree with this take 100%.
I would even consider KFP the perfect trilogy if they didnt focus their last film on being a perfect family movie. Maybe its just me getting older, but it didnt feel the same as the first 2 movies. I could watch KFP 1 and 2 over and over again. I can't do the same with 3 and that seperates a good movie from 2 great movies. Don't get me wrong they didn't have to kill anyone in the last movie to make it a great movie.",1595864338
25,DreamWorks,"Shrek made more money but Kung fu panda is far out the better franchise on multiple levels

Now they are both amazing and both have amazing characters with great stories within them so I can‚Äôt decide between either of them there.

What makes Kung fu panda much better is the raw emotions you can get out of it, and a lot of that is down to the amazing scores by Hans Zimmer, shrek just dosent have that same level of emotion to it.

Also on a personal note I found Kung fu panda funnier, shrek is more meme-able but in terms of actual humour that made me laugh KFP wins",1595845500

36,DreamWorks,"The ""coy smile"" developmentally happens between 4-18months old. Being that we see this baby curled up in a ""moses basket"" and such a basket is used for newborns to be safely near their parents without risk of co-sleeping death, baby Moses is probably under 12 months old. And since he was able to grasp his mother's finger slightly more accurately than the Palmar Grasp Reflex of newborns, he's probably older than 4 months. So, baby Moses is 4-12months  old when he makes his river trip.

Biblical accounts state his mother hid him for at least 3 months, so he my be closer to 4-5 months old.",1595575481

""We'll all be safe here in place B.""

""Hey, the dragons will be even *safer* in place C.""

I get it. The story of Berk is about them learning to try new things and grow. But, like, old Berk is a day East. Start a colony...",1595565648
38,DreamWorks,"Right. They *both* helped one another grow into the leaders they now are. 

Without Toothless, Hiccup stays an unhappy black sheep, potentially homeless if his community is scattered by the various villains they had to stop. With Toothless, their community has a smarter, wiser, more caring leader than they've ever had.

Without Hiccup, Toothless is alone in the world. He never overcomes the Bewylderbeast and becomes another mindless slave &amp; tool of oppression rather than a respectful leader.

Most importantly, *both* the communities of New Bern and the Hidden World are better for their time together in much the same way. 

The Berkians, once insular traditionalists now value innovation and progress.

The dragons had been on the verge of extinction and mass enslavement, knowing nothing but the rule of the biggest and strongest, but are now safe &amp; thriving in a new &amp; mutually beneficial golden age.

And there's no reason to believe the relationship between those communities won't continue to flourish. Consider how either would react to a military attack on the other. 

Now where's the show where Toothless has to risk his position on the unpopular political position that they not eat one another but become a community of strict pescatarians?",1595565341

Shrek exists somewhere in North America, the dragon is a similar dragon from httyd except instead of hiding from the world it was imprisoned in a castle. 
The reasoning behind why I think kfp also exists here is that the level of development is the same in terms of architecture. Also they we see multiple magical creatures in shrek like fairies, talking pigs etc. Is it so far to assume that Asia in the same time period (which hasn‚Äôt yet been explored by humans) has a similar sort of magic that allows animals to talk and build etc. 

In the full theory I develop the idea of continental magic and how it varies across the world",1595013753

91,DreamWorks,schaffrillas productions my crab lord,1594632785
92,DreamWorks,"So I disagree with this a little, of a film flops a film crew won‚Äôt get thrown away at dreamworks, in fact I think the studio encourages them to try something else. The only problem there is money, they can only have so many flops before they start loosing money. 

With Disney not only do they strive for perfection but they are the company more likely to drop you if a film flops. Not only that but if the film Disney have enough political ideals in it they won‚Äôt like that either",1594591144
93,DreamWorks,"I agree Disney will always outspend THATS very true. What they will not do is allow for growth - I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs not only competitive in the art departments but at every level down to the recording booth teams and directors. 

They look for a level of perfectionism as a constant expectation. Because they operate in the fact that the pool of candidates is oceans wide. They don‚Äôt have to worry about not finding ‚Äúthe right employee‚Äù when they have as many applicants as they have. I think this creates a very uneasy relationship in terms of networking and growth because everyone at every level is your competition. 

For Dreamworks I‚Äôve heard they are more openly able to allow growth but their shortcomings are tied to the financial abilities. When a film flops or doesn‚Äôt do well commercially it‚Äôs easy to cut the entire crew from the books and start fresh to just ‚Äúbury the mistake‚Äù so to speak.",1594590398
94,DreamWorks,"Here‚Äôs the thing, Disney gives you lots of money to tell a story, however they DO NOT take risks. Your story has to be one already in some sort of history or story. Also every one of their movies now need to have a political statement, whether that be women rights, black rights, animal rights, global warming etc. This means that your creative freedom at Disney is greatly restricted.

Dreamworks however allows for that creativity. They listen to unique stories and create and tell unique stories with mature themes. However they aren‚Äôt without their problems. For one they do not have the same money as Disney which means, they often follow the money rather than a good story. This means we get films like boss baby and trolls rather than masterpieces like how to train your dragon or Kung fu panda.

Altogether tho I would say both are great companies to work for",1594546440
